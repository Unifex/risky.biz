<p>There is no feature interview in this week's show. If you tuned in last week you would have heard HD Moore and I talking about a project called Invisible.im. Well, we launched a FAQ and the Internet liked it... the Internet *really* liked it... so I've spent much of the week working on invisible.im. There's some really cool stuff happening there that I can't really talk about yet, but I can say the project has picked up a lot of interest.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>There's some very cool stuff happening and I'll be able to talk more about it soon.</p>
<p>So, in this week's show we're going to have a chat about the week's infosec news with Adam Boileau, then we'll have a really interesting talk with Chris Gatford, head honcho with this week's sponsor Hacklabs. We're chatting with Chris all about the case of the public transport Victoria website receiving a "free pentest" from a 16-year-old kid. He reported a bug, didn't hear anything back after a couple of days, then went to the press. The whole thing blew up and he wound up in a bunch of hot water with the police.</p>
<p>Anyway, the whole episode came to a conclusion this week. The kid had to sign a statement acknowledging that he'd committed a crime, but beyond that there was no further sanction. </p>
<p>"Unsolicited pentests" are a murky, murky area. Chris joins us to chat about this case and how we might move towards some sort of consensus on how things should actually happen in these situations.</p>
