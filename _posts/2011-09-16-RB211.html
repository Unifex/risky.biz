<p>On this week's show we chat with Ruxcon organiser and vulnerability researcher Chris Spencer.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Chris pops by to offer a five percent discount on Ruxcon training to Risky Business listeners, and we also have a quick chat to him about trends in the vulnerability research game.</p>
<p>Chris was popping shells and publishing exploits since the nineties, so he's seen a few things change!</p>
<p>Also this week, RSA's Mason Hooper joins the show for this week's sponsor interview. We ask Mason for his thoughts on a not-particularly-convincing Norton survey report that estimates cybercrime is now bigger than the illegal drugs industry. Ha!</p>
<p>Mark "Longpipes" Piper is this week's news guest. He's filling in while Adam Boileau is in Afghanistan seeking advanced beard grooming tips.</p>
