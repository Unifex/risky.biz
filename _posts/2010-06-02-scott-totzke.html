<p>Mobile security is all the rage these days, so when Research In Motion (RIM) VP of security Scott Totzke came to Australia a few weeks ago, we made sure we got an interview.</p>
<p>RIM is the company that makes the Blackberry. While it doesn't have as many cool points as the iPhone, the Blackberry has become the mobile workhorse of the modern enterprise. US President Barack Obama famously insisted on keeping his Blackberry when he came to office, so obviously anything Scott has to say about mobile security deserves to be heard.</p>
<p>I spoke to him by phone a couple of weeks ago.</p>
