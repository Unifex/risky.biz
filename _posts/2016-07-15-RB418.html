<p>On this week's show we're chatting with The Grugq about secure messaging. Facebook has announced it's rolling out an end-to-end encryption feature and the reaction to this wonderful announcement has been somewhat bizarre. We'll be talking to Grugq about why crypto absolutists are hating on companies that are rolling out non-default e2e features. We'll also talk about a couple of interesting case studies in which e2e encryption did absolutely nothing for the people using it.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's show is brought to you by Sensepost, an absolutely fantastic security firm that operates in England and South Africa. Sensepost has been an academy for security luminaries over the years. Haroon Meer of Thinkst was an early stage employee, Maltego creator Roelof Temmingh was a co-founder. </p>
<p>So, they're smart. And one of the things SensePost does is security training at BlackHat in Las Vegas. They've been doing this for 15 years and Sensepost's Daniel Cuthbert will be joining us in this week's sponsor interview to talk about what courses they're offering and who winds up actually taking them. The really interesting part is it's not always security professionals in those courses.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, joins us to discuss the week's security news headlines.</p>
<p>Oh, and do add <a href="https://twitter.com/riskybusiness">Patrick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/metlstorm">Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.</p>
