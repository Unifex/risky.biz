<p>On this week's show we have a look at PowerShell, the Microsoft sorta scripting language admin thingy. As it turns out, PowerShell can be an attacker's best friend when it comes to lateral movement through a network. We'll chat with Kieran Jacobson about that in this week's feature interview. He did a cracker presentation at CrikeyCon where he demo'd owning a domain controller and dumping all its creds with something like five lines of PowerShell. I mean, there are caveats there, but wow... the demotime was food for thought.</p>

<p>This week's show is sponsored by HackLabs. HackLabs head honcho Chris Gatford joins the program in this week's sponsor interview to have a yarn about the upcoming great XP switch of 2014. Ditching XP in your environment shouldn't be a supreme challenge, but what about specialist devices? Like the heart monitor that you can't patch but needs to be networked so you can know Mr. Jones in 14F is about to have a heart attack? Yeah, that'd be one of those intractable problems. Yay.</p>
