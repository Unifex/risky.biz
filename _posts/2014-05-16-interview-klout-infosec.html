<p>You're about to hear my interview with Matt Jones, a security consultant who runs a small outfit named Volvent.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>He's been working on a very interesting side project for a couple of years now. Essentially it's a social media analyser that identifies sources of high-quality information. Users can tap in a keyword and drill through the conversations on social media that actually matter -- the conversations that influence the influencers. The project was born of Matt's desire to never have to log in to Twitter again.</p>
