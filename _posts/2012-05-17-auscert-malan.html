<p>In this sponsored Arbor Networks founder and CTO Rob Malan.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>If you're lucky enough to have met Rob, you'd know that not only has he built a crazily successful business, but he's one of the most technologically savvy people you will ever meet. He lives and breathes his business, and lately he's been focussing on what he sees as a future problem area: Denial of service attacks against mobile 3G and 4G/LTE networks.</p>
<p>As you'll hear, Rob says the average mobile network is a bit of a disaster and there'll be plenty of opportunities for miscreants to wreak havoc on them.</p>
