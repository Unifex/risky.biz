<p><em>Australian Taxation Office together with Australian Business Register<br/>
wants to inform you that starting from January, 1 2012 new rules of use of ABN number are being introduced. </em></p>
<p><em>The changes will concern:<br/>
<em>- GST credits;<br/>
<em>- Australian domain names registration</em></em></em></p>
<p><em>More detailed information about the coming changes in the rules you can find HERE.</em></p>
<p><em>Australian Business Register<br/>
www.abr.gov.au</em></p>
<p>All links in the e-mail go to the domain australianbusiness-store.com. </p>
<p>That site drops an executable named updateTax15sept.pdf.exe. </p>
<p>Geez. I wonder if I should run it?</p>
<p>I also received a couple of other, similar messages purporting to come from the ATO. Again, all links pointed to the domain australianbusiness-store.com.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Drop domain australianbusiness-store.com at your gateway.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Our buddy Neal Wise at Assurance.com.au says the same spam run makes use of the domain australian-businesssite.com, too... Some on Twitter have reported hundreds of these spams coming through their gateway just this morning. Seems very tightly focussed on an Australian audience.</p>
