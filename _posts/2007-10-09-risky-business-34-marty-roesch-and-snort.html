<p>Risky Business returns to normal programming today. Patrick Gray is back from his holiday in the tropics and he's feeling just dandy, thanks for asking.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's show is a long one -- we had to make up for last week's 16 minute podcast. On this week's program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patrick Gray and ZDNet Australia's Munir Kotadia discuss the week's security news</li>
<li>Sourcefire CTO Martin Roesch discuss the future of Snort and the commercialisation of open source software</li>
<li>Marshal's Director of Product Management Bradley Anstis tells us how spammers are using Youtube to peddle their grubby little messages</li>
<li>Verizon Business's Sean Lord joins us for this week's sponsor interview. We'll be talking about distributed denial of service attacks</li>
</ul>
