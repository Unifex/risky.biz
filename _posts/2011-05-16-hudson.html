<p>In this interview we hear from Tim Hudson, an independent cryptography dude, who, as you'll hear, may or may not have worked on Queensland's Smart Card drivers license project. Absurdly, on legal advice, he can't actually tell us if he worked on that project.</p>

<p>There were mutterings in the Queensland state parliament some time ago about a project consultant criticising the rollout... the minister responsible also said something about the department exploring legal options to shut said critic up. Geez, I wonder if it was Tim?</p>
<p>Tim did a presentation here at AusCERT earlier today... I asked him to tell me what he spoke about.</p>
