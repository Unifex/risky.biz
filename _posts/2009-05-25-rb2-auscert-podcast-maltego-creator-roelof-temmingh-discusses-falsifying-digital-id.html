<p>The following audio is an excerpt from Maltego creator Roelof Temmingh's AusCERT presentation. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Maltego is a very interesting bit of information visualisation software. If you haven't heard of it, check it out.</p>
<p>We've all heard the saying that we all leave digital footprints on the web. Well, in this part of his talk Roelof talks about creating false footprints, or false online identities.</p>
<p>It's seriously interesting stuff and not the sort of thing that you normally hear about at a security conference. We'll be posting an interview with Roelof at some point also.</p>
