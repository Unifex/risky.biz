<p>On this week's show we're chatting with computer crime lawyer extraordinaire Tor Ekeland! He's worked on a number of high profile CFAA cases. Most recently he's been defending former Reuters and LA Times journalist Matthew Keys on some pretty hefty CFAA charges. He's also the guy who got Andrew Aurenheimer out of jail so he could go and live a free life as a Nazi troll. (Is that really a win?) He also defended Lauri Love... basically if you're a hacker who's fallen foul of the CFAA, this is the guy you want on your team.</p>

<p>He joins us this week to talk about the CFAA, terrorism charges against hackers, and the American cultural influences over crime and punishment in the USA. It's a cracker interview, that one.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Telstra! Best known as Australia's incumbent telco, Telstra also offers enterprise services. There's a link to their services page in this week's <a hef="http://risky.biz/RB389_notes">show notes</a>.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with Rachael Falk. She leads the Cyber Influence team in Telstra Security Operations. And she'll be joining us with what I'm calling boardroom ammo. Five questions you can suggest to your CEO or board to get them thinking about good security practices.</p>
