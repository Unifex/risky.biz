<p>This week's show is sponsored by Sophos, and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte Virtual Hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's feature interview we'll be hearing from former Network Solutions CSO Richard Forno. </p>
<p>He's joining us to discuss a proposed bill in the USA that would require all information security professionals working on government systems to hold some sort of certification. It's an interesting idea, but Forno hates it. </p>
<p>Also on this week's show, Paul Ducklin from <a href="http://sophos.com.au/" target="new">Sophos</a> pops in to do his best to debunk the GhostNet conspiracy. Researchers from Cambridge and Toronto Universities claim to have uncovered a clandestine, state-sponsored espionage ring targeting pro Tibet politicians. </p>
<p>Ducklin is very sceptical and will be along soon to tell us why.</p>
<p>Declan Ingram of <a href="http://securusglobal.com/" target="new">Securus Global</a> is this week's news guest.<br/>
