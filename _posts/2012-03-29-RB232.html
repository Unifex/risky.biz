<p>This week we talk to CommsDay founder and publisher Grahame Lynch about the Australian Government's decision to ban Chinese Networking vendor Huawei from supplying equipment to the National Broadband Network.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The government says it will block Huawei's participation in the rollout of the $36 billion network on security grounds following a negative assessment by Australian spy agency ASIO. Read Grahame's take <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>Is this a decision that really makes sense from a pure political point of view? Or could there be some political considerations at play here? Grahame clues us in.</p>
