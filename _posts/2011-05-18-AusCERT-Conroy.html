<p>Our coverage of the conference is brought to you by the fine folks at Microsoft -- without their support, there would be no AusCERT podcasts, so big thanks to MS!</p>

<p>As a part of that sponsorship Risky Business is posting a few sponsored podcasts -- this is one of them, an interview with Microsoft's Identity specialist Paul Conroy. In it, we discuss what enterprise customers out there are actually looking for, as well as having a bit of a chat about SAML 2.0 -- an authentication protocol that you can use... and I can't believe I'm going to say this. In the... cloud. I said cloud. I'm sorry. But listen to the interview, it'll make sense.</p>
