<p>In this interview we're chatting with Neal Wise of Assurance.com.au. Don't let the accent fool you, Neal is based in Melbourne and has been for as long as I can remember, and he did a great talk here at the AusCERT conference called Hacking the Gibson, which was all about pwning supercomputers.</p>

<p>I warn you in advance that there are a few references from the movie Hackers in this interview... sorry about that... HACK THE PLANET!! .... but yeah, Neal has been doing some work involving supercomputers and I decided to interview him about them. They make excellent bitcoin mining boxes!</p>
