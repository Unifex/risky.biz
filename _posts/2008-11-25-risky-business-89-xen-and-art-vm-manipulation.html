<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by <a href="http://tenablesecurity.com" target="new">Tenable Network Security</a> and hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week we take a look at VM security with financial services company CSO Adam Pointon and <a href="http://assurance.com.au/" target="new">Assurance.com.au's</a> Neal Wise. The fellas say a recently disclosed <a href="http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX118766" target="new">flaw in the Citrix Xen hypervisor software</a> should give us all pause. There are some exceptionally crappy virtualisation setups going up left right and centre, Adam and Neal say, and it's only a matter of time before bad practice comes back to bite everyone on the ass.</p>
<p>We'll also check in with Symantec's Tom Powledge, the head of the company's consumer products division. Powledge joins us to discuss Microsoft's decision to give away free anti-virus. He's far from convinced it'll have a negative impact on Symantec's business.</p>
<p>Tenable Network Security CSO Marcus Ranum also drops in for this week's sponsor interview. We spoke to Marcus about his keynote speech from the Hack in The Box conference in Malaysia.</p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/" target="new">ZDNet Australia's</a></i> editor, Munir Kotadia, also stops in for a chuckle over the week's news headlines.</p>
