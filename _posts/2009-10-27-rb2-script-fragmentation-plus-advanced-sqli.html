<p>In this podcast you'll hear our roving reporter Paul Craig interviewing a couple of presenters from BruCon, Belgium's security conference.</p>
<p>In the first interview, Paul chats to Stephan Chenette of Websense about script fragmentation, a concept that's a bit similar to TCP fragmentation for IDS evasion. </p>
<p>Interview number two is about advanced SQL injection attacks, with Gotham Digital Science's Justin Clarke.</p>
