This week we'll be having a chat to Paul Marsh about a recent report from UK think tank Chatham House that says there's 
a looming cyber security crisis about to wreak havoc on the satellite ecosystem. But as you'll hear, Paul thinks the 
concerns are somewhat overhyped.

In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Space Rogue, aka Tenable Network Security's very own Cris Thomas. He's 
joining us this week to talk about election security. Two new bills dealing with the security of voting computers have 
been proposed in the USA. We'll get Cris's thoughts on how likely they are to actually make a difference. We also have
a general discussion around the security of e-voting infrastructure.

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest.

Oh, and do add [Patrick](https://twitter.com/riskybusiness) and [Adam](https://twitter.com/metlstorm) on Twitter if that's your thing.
