<p>Microsoft was kind enough to sponsor our coverage of AusCERT's 2011 conference and as a part of that sponsorship arrangement we're doing these sponsored podcasts. They're general chats with Microsoft peeps about security issues.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>And in this interview we're chatting with Microsoft Australia's Chief Security Advisor Stuart Strathdee about the affect the PSN network breach has had on large organisations' security outlook. As you'll hear, Stuart says a lot of security projects that had been on the back burner are now being brought forward.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
