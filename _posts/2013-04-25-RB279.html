<p>This week's edition of the show is pre-recorded because I'm off surfing in Jeffreys Bay, South Africa. There will be no show next week, but the week after that I'll be bringing you an episode from the ITWeb Security Summit in Johannesburg where I'm speaking.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's show we've got a great interview with Wade Baker, the managing principal of Verizon's RISK team, and the topic, of course, is this year's Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report.</p>
<p>We've also got a sponsor interview with Marcus Ranum of Tenable Network Security. Tenable is this week's sponsor, so you can thank them for making this week's show possible. Do check out Tenable.com for all your vulnerability scanning and SIEM needs!</p>
<p>We chat with Marcus about what he calls economic spoiler attacks -- these are the disruptive, state-sponsored attacks we've seen against Saudi Aramco and South Korea.</p>
<p>If you'd like to download this week's track, you can grab it for free from the TripleJ Unearthed website <a href="http://www.triplejunearthed.com/TheDeltaRiggs1" target="new">here</a>.</p>
