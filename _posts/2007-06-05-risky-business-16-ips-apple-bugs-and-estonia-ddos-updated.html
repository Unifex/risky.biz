<!--excerpt-above-->

<ul>
<li>Munir Kotadia from ZDNet Australia joins us with the news</li>
<li>Karl Hanmore from AusCERT updates us on this week's threats and has some good news</li>
<li>Juniper Networks security research manager Steve Manzuik talks about the limitations of IPS, then discusses the remote root vulnerability his team found in Apple's OS X operating system</li>
<li>Cybertrust's Paul Nevin joins us to chat about the massive DDoS that crippled Estonia</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE</b>: Well some silly chicken at ITRadio.com.au HQ "clucked up" yesterday. We forgot to include our semi-regular AusCERT slot with Karl Hanmore! He had some interesting things to say this week about AV vulnerabilities and a new tool published by Microsoft that allows computer users to run binary to XML conversions on Office files. If you're a keen listener, you can hear the segment by itself <a href="http://www.itradio.com.au/wp-content/uploads/forgotten_karl.mp3" target="new">here</a>.</p>
