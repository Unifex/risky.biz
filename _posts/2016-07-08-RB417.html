<p>In this week's feature interview we're chatting with Stanford's very own Jennifer Granick about a recent ruling in a Virginia court that appears to give the FBI permission to hack into any computer it wants, sans warrant. Well that's what the headlines are screaming, anyway. But as you'll hear, it's not quite that black and white.</p>

<p>This week's edition of the show is brought to you by Senetas, big thanks to them. We'll of course be hearing from Senetas founder and CTO Julian Fay later on in this week's sponsor segment. He's joining us to talk about the latest guidance from NIST with regard to moving towards quantum resistant encryption. You've heard Julian and I discuss why NIST thinks the industry should do this, now we're going to talk about the how.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, joins us to discuss the week's security news headlines.</p>
<p>Oh, and do add <a href="https://twitter.com/riskybusiness">Patrick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/metlstorm">Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.</p>
