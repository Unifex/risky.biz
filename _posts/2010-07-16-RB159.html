<p>On this week's show we take a fresh look at the insider threat in light of the news, here in Australia, that criminal syndicates are paying up to $40,000 to bribe service station attendants into helping them skim cards. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>If the bad guys are willing to pay $40k for someone that low on the food chain, what will they pay to get at someone in your organisation?</p>
<p>To find out we'll be joined by Gartner research director, AusCERT co-founder and former Commonwealth Bank security big-wig Rob McMillan.</p>
<p>Also this week we chat with Kaspersky's Vitaly Kamlyuk in the sponsor interview. </p>
<p>We'll be chatting about Mozilla's blocking of a malicious plugin that siphoned usernames and passwords off unsuspecting users. What should browser manufacturers be doing to stop this sort of thing from happening? </p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, stops in with the week's news.</p>
