<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by <a href="http://tenablesecurity.com" target="new">Tenable Network Security</a>.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>It's been a fairly quiet week so we've prepared a shorter than usual show. In this week's podcast we take a look at the depressing state of the Internet -- a recent 'net-wide scan by nmap creator Fyodor found Telnet is the second most commonly open port. <strong>Marcus Ranum</strong> pops in to discuss the possible role of backbone providers in mopping up this outrageously shite style of systems management.</p>
<p>ZDNet Australia's <strong>Munir Kotadia</strong> is also along this week to discuss the news. Nothing earth-shattering -- a few bugs in Google's newly-released Chrome browser, some Facebook application badness and a downright skeletal-challenging backflip on the part of MythBusters' host Adam Savage.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
