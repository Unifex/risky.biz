<p>There's lots of fun news in this week's show. Sony Pictures got absolutely flattened, Regin is all the rage and the SEA has been enjoying some success.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's feature interview we're chatting with Claudio Guarnieri about his tool Detekt. It copped an absolute tonne of criticism on Twitter over the last week or so, but as you'll hear, most of the critics were kind of missing the point about what Claudio was trying to achieve. I know, I know, the idea that someone on Twitter might have been wrong is crazy, but just listen to the interview and see what you think. Claudio joins us via Skype from Berlin for a chat about Detekt!</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Websense, big thanks to them. Websense principal security researcher Carl Leonard will join us from London to do something very, very brave. He's going to make some predictions for what we could see in the malware space in 2015. Brave is the soul who makes predictions in this discipline. That's this week's sponsor interview, with thanks again to Websense!</p>
