<p>On this week's show we've landed what looks to be a fairly exclusive interview -- at least as far as the tech press is concerned. Justine Bone will be joining us to explain why the company she works with, MedSec, decided to use vulnerability information on implantable medical devices to drive a short-selling scheme in partnership with Muddy Waters.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's show is sponsored by Tenable Network Security. We're doing something a bit different in this week's sponsor interview -- we're chatting with one of Tenable's customers, City of San Diego CISO Gary Hayslip. </p>
<p>They've just invested heavily in Nessus, among other things. Gary drops by to explain what he's been doing since he took the CISO position a few years ago. If you're a CISO it's actually a pretty interesting interview. That team has to deal with everything from embedded devices in cop cars to control systems to its very own POS network. Hey, citizens have to pay for government services somehow, right?</p>
<p>Trail of Bits head honcho Dan Guido is this week's news guest.</p>
<p>Oh, and do add <a href="https://twitter.com/riskybusiness">Patrick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dguido">Dan</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.</p>
