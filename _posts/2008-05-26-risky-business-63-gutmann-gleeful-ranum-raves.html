<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is sponsored by Tenable Network Security and hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week we're back to normal programming after attending AusCERT's annual conference last week. In all, the Risky Business crew managed to put up 21 podcasts over five days, featuring interviews and full presentations. Check it out <a href="http://itradio.com.au/auscert08">here</a>.</p>
<p>On this week's show, however, we hear from Peter Gutmann. You've heard Peter argue in these podcasts (<a href="http://itradio.com.au/security/?p=52">part 1</a>, <a href="http://itradio.com.au/security/?p=53">part 2</a>) that the idea that hundreds of dedicated open source fans are busy auditing code for security bugs, right now, is fanciful to say the least.</p>
<p>In light of the Debian disaster, we thought we'd touch base with Peter again to see if there's anything that can be done to incentivise the discovery of open source bugs.</p>
<p>Also on this week's show, security legend and <a href="http://tenablesecurity.com" target="new">Tenable</a> CSO Marcus Ranum joins us in this week's sponsor interview. Marcus joined us to talk about innovation -- or the lack thereof -- in the security industry. It's a case of the same old solutions to the same old problems.</p>
<p>And of course, Munir Kotadia from ZDNet Australia pops in to chew the fat with host Patrick Gray in our regular news segment.</p>
