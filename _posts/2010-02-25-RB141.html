<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by Kaspersky and hosted by Virtual.Offis.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week we take a look at patch management and ask why it still sucks. Security professionals have been advising their clients to sort out their patching processes for more than ten years, but it's still at the top of many, many a post-audit report.</p>
<p>We chat to Securosis analyst Rich Mogull about his research on patch management.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview with chat with Kaspersky Labs' Vitaly Kamlyuk about the next generation of ransomware doing the rounds in the Russian Federation. Let's hope it doesn't wind up here!</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, is this week's news guest.</p>
