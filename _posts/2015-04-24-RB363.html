<p>This week's show was cut together from our nation's capital, Canberra!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>I've been down here to attend the Australian Cyber Security Centre conference, which was actually pretty good. There were some great technical talks. One of them was by Balint Seeber on Software defined radio haxing, he\u2019s our feature guest in this week's show.</p>
<p>We'll talk to him about messing around with aircraft radar, ACARS, keyless entry and all sorts of stuff. He even managed to take control of a satellite 15 million kilometres from Earth from his laptop while he was in a DEFCON talk! (Don't try this at home. Or do. I don't know what advice to give on that one.)</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security, makes of fine, fine information security software like Nessus. If you aren't familiar with Tenable's stuff you really should be, they make some excellent kit. Head to <a href="http://tenable.com/">Tenable.com</a>to check that out.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with Tenable's strategist Jack Daniel. He's over at the RSA conference and he'll be giving us a rundown on what it's like there. Over 500 exhibitors this year. Crazy.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, is in the news chair this week.</p>
<p>Links to everything are in this week's <a>show notes</a>.</p>
