<p>This week's podcast was recorded and prepared at the <a href="http://www.govcert.nl/symposium/" target="new">GovCERT Symposium</a> in Rotterdam. This week's feature guest is <strong>David Rice</strong>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Geekonomics-Real-Cost-Insecure-Software/dp/0321477898" target="new">Geekonomics</a>.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Rice argues the pervasiveness of software and systems vulnerabilities are a symptom of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failures" target="new">market failure</a>, and the only way out is for governments to introduce economic incentives -- similar to those being considered to reduce carbon emissions -- to whip the vendors in shape.</p>
<p>This week's sponsor guest is Microsoft's Chief Privacy Strategist <strong>Peter Cullen</strong>. Peter joins the show to discuss, perhaps not surprisingly, privacy in the digital age.</p>
