<p>This week's feature interview is with Matt Olney of Sourcefire's vulnerability research team. These guys have put a bunch of work into a new open source tool that can grab files, like PDFs, off the wire, scan them for dodgy stuff and trigger Snort alerts. </p>

<p>It's called <a href="http://vrt-sourcefire.blogspot.com/2010/04/new-detection-framework.html" target="new">Near Real Time detection</a> and it might just have legs. </p>
<p>This week's edition of the show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security, and as is our custom here at Risky.Biz HQ we chat with Tenable's CEO and industry stalwart Ron Gula in this week's sponsor interview. In it we discuss McAfee's borked update of a couple of weeks ago, logic bugs in the cloud and more.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, drops in to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
<p>You can find more info on NRT <a href="http://labs.snort.org/nrt/" target="new">here</a>.</p>
