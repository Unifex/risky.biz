<p>This special edition of Risky Business was recorded in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, at the GOVCERT.NL security conference. The conference organisers flew me there to host a couple of ask the expert sessions and record some custom interviews... but I got to record my own stuff too and prepare this special.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This podcast is essentially a bunch of interviews I did at the conference, glued together for your listening pleasure. Big thanks to our advertiser MessageLabs for making this week's show possible!</p>
<p>On this week's show you'll hear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marcus Sachs</strong> of the Internet Storm Centre (Day job: Verizon) talks supply chain subversion and fun with USB devices. (Hint: Load them up with malware then leave them in the bathrooms of your target...) </li>
<li>GovCERT's <strong>Carol Overes</strong> talks HoneySpiders -- they're basically client-side honeypots, but they could have some nifty commercial applications. </li>
<li><strong>Lance Spitzner</strong> looks back at his experience running the Honeynet Project over the years. Honeynets showed some early promise as potential products, ala "bait and switch honeynets". It never happened, so I asked Lance why. </li>
<li>A quick interview with <strong>Bart Jacobs</strong>, the professor who wound up leading the research team that broke NXP Semiconductors' MIFARE RFID access cards. The whole thing has actually turned into a political catastrophe that has potential to divert votes away from the incumbent government... </li>
</ul>
<p>Massive thanks to all the GOVCERT guys -- Eelco, Roeland, Tarik and especially Erik de Jong. Apologies if I spelled any of your freakish European names incorrectly... ;) Coming from Australia I know plenty of alcos, but not too many Eelcos!</p>
