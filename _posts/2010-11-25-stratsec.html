<p>The company operates defence-accredited facilities here in Australia, runs common criteria certification labs and employs around 60 consultants nationwide. Risky.Biz understands the announcement of the sale is imminent.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The company has been aggressively hiring new consultants all over the country since <a href="http://risky.biz/news_and_opinion/staff-writers/2009-05-11/sift-and-stratsec-merge" target="new">merging with a smaller infosec outfit, SIFT</a>, in May this year.</p>
<p>That deal that valued SIFT at A$3.5m and the new, merged company at A$15-$20m. The BAE deal is thought to value Stratsec at the upper end of that range.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition seems a sensible fit for all involved. Military contractors are increasingly ramping up their information security capabilities as government fears of "cyber war" grow to fever pitch. </p>
<p>And when there's a buck to be made out of war of any kind you can bet your ass there's a military contracting firm scuttling around under a nearby rock, ready and willing to take advantage. </p>
<p>Still, ethically speaking I'm fairly confident selling penetration tests at extortionate, military-grade prices beats <a href="http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/cluster-bomb-firm-uses-irish-charity-in-2bn-tax-scheme-1773343.html" target="new">manufacturing cluster bombs</a> and using creative accounting to shift billions in profits off your books to evade tax... so who am I to complain about this wonderful new direction our industry is heading in?</p>
<p>What do you think? Care to <a href="http://risky.biz/forum/exclusive-stratsec-be-acquired-bae-systems" target="new">comment</a>?</p>
