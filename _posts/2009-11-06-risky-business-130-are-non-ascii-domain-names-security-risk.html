<p>This week's show is sponsored by the wonderful people from Tenable Network Security. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's feature interview is with Chris Disspain, the CEO of Australia's domain name regulator auDA. </p>
<p>This week we're discussing the move to Cyrillic domain names -- some media commentators have gone a bit berserk on this one, saying that the move will introduce massive risks because people will be able to do phishing campaigns with domains made up partially of Cyrillic characters.</p>
<p>Chris will be along to talk about why he thinks that's wrong. </p>
<p>We're also joined by Tenable Network Security's CEO Ron Gula in this week's sponsor interview. Ron gives us his take on Rapid7's acquisition of Metasploit.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau also pops in for a look at the week's news headlines.</p>
