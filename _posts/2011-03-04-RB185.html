<p>On this week's show Peter Gutmann drops by to talk about Solid State Drives (SSDs) and digital forensics. Depending on which report you saw over the last week you may have read that it's impossible to reliably delete data from an SSD, or that SSDs are a forensic nightmare because they DO delete so much data.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Well it turns out both statements are correct, and Peter "Gutmann Method" Gutmann joins us to explain how.</p>
<p>Also this week, Tenable Network Security and industry Stalwart CEO Ron Gula joins us to chat about the concept of restricting the sale and export of exploit information or malicious software. How does one determine what is malicious or other in a discipline where almost everything is dual use? That's this week's sponsor interview.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, of course, joins us for the week's news.</p>
<p>******I missed a couple of "naughty words" in this week's edit, so put your headphones on if the kids are about...</p>
