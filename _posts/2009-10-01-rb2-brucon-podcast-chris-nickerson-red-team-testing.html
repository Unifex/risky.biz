<p>In today's podcast you'll hear Risky.Biz's New Zealand correspondent Paul Craig discussing Red Team testing with Chris Nickerson. A Red Team test involves more than just a standard pen test, it's an outright simulated attack. You'll hear Chris speak of crawling through ceilings to get to data centres, stealing trade secrets -- actual documents -- and even having his nose smashed in by an overly enthusiastic security guard.</p>

<p>Paul did this interview at BruCon, a security conference in Brussels, the lucky bastard, and we'll pick up the conversation here where Chris is talking about what sort of stuff he sets out to steal when he's scoping out a Red Team exercise.</p>
