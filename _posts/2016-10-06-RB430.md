On this week's show we are catching up with Mustafa Al-Bassam. He's a lovely young chap from England who was once upon a
time one of the LulzSec crew. Like all the other guys in that crew he got busted, but he didn't spend any time in prison
and these days he is doing really well. He has finished his undergrad, works with some blockchain technology and is about
to start a PhD. He joins us this week to talk about his in depth analysis of the Shadowbrokers dump, as well as to
reflect on his crimes. As you'll hear, he has some regrets.

This week's show is brought to you by Bromium! And last week you might have caught an announcement that Microsoft has
moved virtualisation based security up into the app stack. The Edge browser is getting thrown into a micro VM in certain
circumstances. Of course Microsoft worked with Bromium on all this stuff, so Bromium CTO Simon Crosby will be along to
talk about what Microsoft has actually done here. Bromium, of course, makes fully featured micro VM security software in
addition to helping Microsoft improve windows, so that chat is interesting stuff and it's coming up after this week's
feature.

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest.

Oh, and do add [Patrick](https://twitter.com/riskybusiness) and [Adam](https://twitter.com/metlstorm) on Twitter if that's your thing.
