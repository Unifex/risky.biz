<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting and brought to you by Check Point.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we'll be joined by Gartner analyst Andrew Walls, who's got some less than reassuring things to say about the security of your job in the long term. Apparently the great big destructive meteor, "outsourcing," is about to collide with planet infosec, and when that happens it'll be grim indeed.</p>
<p>We'll also be joined by Steve McDonald, Check Point Australia's Engineering Services Manager, to discuss a softening in the stance of security companies when considering hiring people with a dark past. With guys like Jeff Moss on DHS advisory panels, can we still expect to hear the CEOs of large companies tonking on about how they "don't hire hackers"? Or will they just look a little bit backwards if they do.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, joins the show to discuss the week's news stories.</p>
