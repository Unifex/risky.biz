<p>Microsoft has signed back on as a sponsor for the remainder of the year, and Microsoft Australia's Stuart Strathdee makes his return to the sponsor slot this week to tell us about IE9, which sounds suspiciously like IE8 in a pretty frock... or more accurately like IE8 in a bikini.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau joins us as usual to discuss the week's news.</p>
