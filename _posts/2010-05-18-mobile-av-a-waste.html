<p>In this podcast we chat to two guys from Australian-based security firm Stratsec. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Ben Bromhead and Ken Hendrie spend their lives up to their armpits in Windows mobile devices -- they actually do the worldwide common criteria evaluations for Windows mobile devices right here in Australia. As a result, these guys know a thing or two about mobile device security.</p>
<p>In their presentation, titled simply "mobile security", the two looked at the common threats to mobile devices and some mitigations. I caught up with them after their presentation for this interview.</p>
