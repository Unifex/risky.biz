<p>The US Department of Justice swiftly issued a press release with the catchy, ALL CAPS title of "SIXTEEN INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR ALLEGED ROLES IN CYBER ATTACKS".</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>So this is a massive blow to "Anonymous" and its sophisticated campaign of mayhem, right? </p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>One of the complaints details charges to be laid against <a href="http://media.risky.biz/DoJ/scott.pdf" target="new">Scott Matthew Arciszewski, 22</a>. He's alleged to have somehow created an account on Infragard Tampa's Website and successfully uploaded a couple of files.</p>
<p>By the looks of things he made no attempt to hide his actions -- using his own IP address to conduct the "attack" -- then Tweeted about it and directed his followers toward his Website. </p>
<p>How stealthy.</p>
<p>What a criminal mastermind. I'll sure sleep better tonight knowing this criminal genius has been taken off the streets.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.risky.biz/DoJ/moore.pdf" target="new">Another complaint</a> alleges former AT&amp;T contractor Lance Moore uploaded a bunch of commercially sensitive material to Fileape. That information was subsequently "redistributed" by LulzSec.</p>
<p>This guy isn't even alleged to be sailing aboard the Lulz Boat, but hey, at least the DoJ got to use the word "LulzSec" in an indictment. What a win!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://media.risky.biz/DoJ/group.pdf" target="new">remaining 14 arrests</a> deal with a DDoS attack against PayPal, apparently in retribution for that company's decision to suspend payment processing for Wikileaks. They were using LOIC. How 1337.</p>
<p>So what does this all amount to? A leaker with internal access (AT&amp;T), a young guy who was able to pwn Infragard in about five minutes (great security, guys) and a bunch of LOIC users.</p>
<p>And yet the coverage I'm seeing still persists with this ridiculous idea that the arrests will be some sort of strike against Anonymous, the "group".</p>
<p>So here, let's try to get something straight, once and for all: Anonymous is not a group. It's not a hydra. It's not a "loose collective". Anonymous is just a designation. Why is that so hard to understand? </p>
<p>Let's try an analogy.</p>
<p>17th century pirates liked to steal booty. They sailed the high seas and pillaged. They had a common flag. But they WERE NOT A GROUP.</p>
<p>Sure, there were groups of pirates that sailed on ships together. There was a common outlook -- that plundering booty was a worthwhile activity, ho ho and a bottle of rum, all of that. But they were not a group. </p>
<p>There were pirate hangouts like pirate taverns, so there was congregation, but no leadership. Pirates were not a collective.</p>
<p>So let's clear it all up. The anons are the pirates, IRC channels and imageboards like 4chan are their pirate taverns, and the various Anonymous outfits like @AnonymousIRC and @AnonOPS are pirate ships with multiple pirates aboard. They're groups of pirates! Simple! See?</p>
<p>So when the <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/06/2011613105222988650.html" target="new">Spanish</a>, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/13/us-hacking-anonymous-arrests-idUSTRE75C2XB20110613" target="new">Turkish</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/wikileaks-anonymous-arrest/" target="new">British</a> or whichever police force claims to have arrested "key members" of Anonymous I wonder if they're deliberately misleading the public and their masters, or if they genuinely just don't get it.</p>
<p>This current batch of arrests will "bring to justice" a bunch of people who made no attempt to conceal their actions because they're either technically useless or just didn't care. </p>
<p>They're "low hanging anons".</p>
<p>But that won't stop the mainstream media from portraying this as the establishment striking back at online troublemakers.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Feds arrest dummies, MSM hails capture of anon masterminds.</p>
