<p>This week's feature interview is with Troy Hunt of HaveIBeenPwned.com. And he's noticing something pretty weird. It's common for people to deface websites for bragging rights, and yeah, it's not new that data dumps are the new bragging fodder. But it seems like these days attackers are seeing Troy's site as the definitive place to get cred. Now they'll steal a bunch of data and Troy is their first stop. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Life is strange on the internets. That's this week's feature interview.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by ContextIS, a security consultancy and research house with offices in England, Germany and Australia. In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Alex Farrant, a senior security researcher with Context in Cheltenham about the risks of IoT to enterprise networks. </p>
<p>Don't worry, this isn't some non-specific, high level chat saying "IoT is bad," we're talking about real examples where they've managed to chain together a couple of bugs for serious effect. We also talk about how enterprises aren't shy about making key company resources accessible over WiFi these days. Yes, the same WiFi network that your vulnerable electric kettle and lightbulbs are on. Happy days.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, stops in to discuss the week's news, including the delightful Freudian analysis of computer hackers by "cyber psychologist" Mary Aiken.</p>
