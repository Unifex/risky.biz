<p>On this week's show we'll be chatting with Stratsec's Chief Technology guy Nick Ellsmore about bank fraud liability. A couple in the USA who fell victim to a phishing scam are suing their bank to get their money back. Nick's not a lawyer, but he's one of those guys who follows the law as it relates to security very, very closely, so he'll be on the show to talk about that.</p>

<p>We'll also check in with the head of Australia's domain name regulator auDA, Chris Disspain. A couple of years ago an Australian domain name registrar, Bottle Domains, had its credit card database walked out through the perimeter. That's lead to auDA taking court action and by the looks of things it's set to drag out a bit longer.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we're joined by Microsoft's Stuart Strathdee. That one's a bit of a mixed chat about all sorts of stuff. We're talking all things Microsoft. And there's been a lot of MS-related news of late.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau is this week's news guest.</p>
<p>[<strong>MINOR CORRECTION:</strong> It's mentioned in the show that it's rare for a TLD regulator to take action against registrars. Risky.Biz is told that is not the case.]</p>
