<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by NetWitness!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we look at the history of LIGATT Security and its chief executive Gregory D Evans. He says he's the "world's number one hacker" and racked up multiple appearances on CNN, Bloomberg, Fox News and other respected outlets.</p>
<p>But that hasn't stopped others from labelling Evans a charlatan. </p>
<p>A recent expose by CBS Atlanta in the USA, combined with the release of Evans' mailspool, have upped the level of interest in all things LIGATT. Jericho of Attrition.org has been tracking Evans' business dealings for years. He joins us by phone from the USA to fill us in on the curious case of LIGATT Security.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Eddie Schwartz of <a href="http://netwitness.com/" target="new">NetWitness</a>. He joins the show to talk about some nice generic ways to detect network dodginess and suspicious endpoint behaviour.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins us for the week's news.</p>
