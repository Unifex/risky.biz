<p>We've got a great show for you this week. Mark Dowd of Azimuth Security pops in to talk about the bugs he found in libraries used by secure telephony providers like Silent Circle. They're serious, serious bugs, and they were easy to find. </p>

<p>Also this week we talk to Les Goldsmith of ESD America. ESD is a pretty interesting outfit. They sell the German-developed GSMK Cryptophone, a product that has been around for a very, very long time and is mostly used by militaries and police. They also sell counter surveillance training, bug sweeping gear, armoured vehicles, tactical training and explosives detection dogs, but hey, today we're focussing on the electronic stuff.</p>
<p>We get Les's reaction to the news that the US has been bugging the offices of the European Union, the Ecuadorian embassy and, well, pretty much everyone all the time. He's got some really interesting perspectives on that. </p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Chris Gatford about these awful, awful IPMI vulnerabilities. The Intelligent Platform Management Interface turns out to be anything but! If you haven't heard, it turns out there are serious, protocol-level design flaws in IPMI which are going to make life tough for anyone who's actually using it. it's the sort of thing that will take a long time to truly fix, too.</p>
