<p>This week's podcast looks at a few interesting topics. Apparently the bad guys are about to ditch IRC as a command and control channel for botnets and start using RSS, blogs and steganography to communicate with their zombie armies... sneakily!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The show is brought to you this week by the fine folks at Check Point Software Technologies and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte.</p>
<p>On the podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZDNet Australia's Munir Kotadia discusses the week's news</li>
<li>Immunity Inc's Adam Boileau talks about exploiting Windows' IGMP bug and botnet C&amp;C</li>
<li>Steve MacDonald from Check Point joins us for this week's sponsor interview</li>
</ul>
<p>The music heard at the end of the podcast came from <a href="http://soundfoundation.com.au" target="new">Sound Foundation</a>.</p>
