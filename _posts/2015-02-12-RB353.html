<p>This week's feature interview is with Andy Greenberg, senior writer with WIRED. He's covered Silk Road from the get go, even scoring an in depth interview with DPR before he was caught and unmasked as Ross Ulbricht. He attended every day of Ulbricht's trial and says he was there every minute the jury was.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>He joined me via Skype earlier this week to talk about the trial of Ross Ulbricht, the future of underground markets and the disconnect between Ross Ulbricht's real life and online personas.</p>
<p>In fact, that disconnect is so great that Andy actually feels sorry for Ross Ulbricht, despite the allegation that as the Dread Pirate Roberts he commissioned as many as six murders for hire.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by a new sponsor, Intralinks! These guys have a background doing very specialist work in facilitating mergers and acquisitions, but they're pushing into the enterprise space with a really interesting product which you can think of as an enterprise-grade file sharing service with built in IRM.</p>
<p>Intralinks Richard Anstey joins us a bit later on for a chat about the security challenge presented by file sharing services, and what some solutions might look like. And I've gotta say, even though we talk about their product a bit, it's a very interesting interview.</p>
