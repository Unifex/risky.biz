<p>This edition of RB2 features Ben Hawkes' recent talk at Kiwicon. It was called A History Of Corruption, and it really is a historical recap of memory corruption bugs. It doesn't exactly sound thrilling from that description, but it's a great talk and it's really well delivered.</p>

<p>Hawkes is a young security researcher based in New Zealand who's well and truly on the way up. His work on hacking the Vista heap was pretty awesome. If you are familiar with it then you know why a talk about memory corruption as done by Hawkes is going to be interesting. He knows what he's talking about.</p>
