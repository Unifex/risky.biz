<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by Check Point Software.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's show we take a look at two burning issues: The Internet Explorer 0day that's doing the rounds, and we also talk about e-discovery with <strong>Adam Daniel</strong> from Deloitte Forensic Data.</p>
<p>Adam explains why e-discovery solutions are all the rage, how they work, and why they're required.</p>
<p>Check Point's <strong>Steve MacDonald</strong> stops by for this week's sponsor interview -- a discussion around this disastrous, unpatched IE bug that's very much being exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>As always, ZDNet Australia's editor <strong>Munir Kotadia</strong> pops in for a chat about this week's news. </p>
