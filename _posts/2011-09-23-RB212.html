<p>This week's feature guest is the head honcho of the Beef Project, NGS Secure's Wade Alcorn. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Wade joins the program to talk about the SSL/TLS flaw that Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong plan to demonstrate at the Ekoparty security conference. They've found some really nice flaws in TLS 1.0 that mean you can, under some circumstances, when six planets align in the June dawn, extract session cookies from SSL connections.</p>
<p>It's not a bug that marks the end of the world, but it's just a really interesting one so Wade will be along to discuss it.</p>
<p>And this week we check the news headlines with Mark "Longpipes" Piper.</p>
