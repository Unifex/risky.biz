<p>On this week's show we're chatting with F-Secure's Jarno Niemela about some of the issues with Authenticode. He'll tell us about one fascinating case where a piece of malware actually carried a valid signature from a real company... stolen keys, right? As it turned out, that company didn't make software and had no idea what an Authenticode cert actually was. Jarno got to the bottom of that little mystery and tells us all about it after the news with Adam Boileau.</p>

<p>In this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with Tenable Network Security's CSO Marcus Ranum about a new project being run by DARPA, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. </p>
<p>The project is called CINDER and it's all about detecting rogue insider behaviour. It has potential to be a VERY interesting project, and Marcus shares his thoughts on it.</p>
