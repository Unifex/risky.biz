<p>This is the last full-format Risky Business podcast for 2007. Next week we'll be bringing you some Kiwicon talks and lectures. It's a summer listening vibe, people. (Offered with sympathy to listeners freezing their extremities off in the Northern Hemisphere. We're all about to slip off down to the beach with surfboards and cold beer for a couple of months here in Oz. Suffer!)</p>
