<p>In this week's feature interview you'll hear part two of my interview with In-Q-Tel's CSO Dan Geer. We chat with Dan about electronic surveillance, the state, fascism and even the "digital Amish". </p>

<p>He is, as always, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Geer" target="new">fascinating</a>.</p>
<p>This week's edition of the show is brought to you by <a href="http://hacklabs.com/" target="new">Hacklabs</a>, an Australian penetration testing firm. Some homegrown support! Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>Hacklabs very own Chris Gatford will be along in this week's sponsor interview to have a chat about Glenn Mangham, the Brit who's now <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/feb/17/facebook-hacker-glenn-mangham-jailed" target="new">serving a prison term</a> for hacking Facebook despite his claim to be all very, very white-hatty.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, checks in to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
