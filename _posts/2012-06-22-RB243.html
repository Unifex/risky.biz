<p><a href="http://insomniasecurity.com/" target="new">Insomnia Security's</a> Mark Piper tackles all that at the top of the show. He's filling in for Adam Boileau.</p>
<p>Also in this week's show we're chatting with Adobe's director of product security and privacy Brad Arkin. We're talking to him all about an opinion piece Bruce Schneier <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceschneier/2012/05/30/the-vulnerabilities-market-and-the-future-of-security/" target="new">wrote for Forbes</a> about twisted incentives in the vulnerability market. It's interesting stuff. </p>
<p>That's this week's sponsor interview.</p>
<p>There's no feature interview this week and possibly no podcast next week. Family stuff.</p>
