<p>On this week's show we'll be chatting with Forbes' London bureau chief Parmy Olson.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Parmy did a great job of covering the whole LulzSec fiasco last year for Forbes, but she's gone one better and written a book about the whole thing. It's called <em>We Are Anonymous: Inside the hacker world of LulzSec</em> and you know what? It's pretty good!</p>
<p>Actually, it's really, really good. I'm about a third of the way through a review copy. Parmy will joins us to talk about what it was like to stitch a story like this together.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by those fine folk at HackLabs, a Sydney-based penetration testing firm. Its founder and big cheese Chris Gatford will be along in this week's sponsor interview to chat about two factor via cellphones.</p>
<p>There was a really interesting attack against 4chan through its hosting provider ClousdFlare this week that involved some telephone trickery. Do people place too much trust on out of band second factors? Find out in this week's sponsor interview!</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins us to talk about ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE GETTING OWNED! Between LinkedIn, eHarmony and Last.fm getting popped, the US as good as claiming credit for Stuxnet, Flame man in the middling Windows Update and all sorts of other crazy stuff, well, it's been a hell of a week for news!</p>
