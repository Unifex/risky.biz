<p>I'm back from a two week holiday in beautiful Indonesia, so we'll be spending most of this show catching up on what I missed while I was away! So there's plenty of news to talk about with Adam Boileau, and also a chat about some very interesting politicking going on in New Zealand. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>A hacker going by the name of Whaledump has been dropping leaked emails and documents all over the place that are causing all sorts of headaches for the government. If that wasn't enough, Kim Dot Com has jumped into the fray... apparently he has a big reveal coming on September 15th that could change the course of the NZ election campaign. Is this the future of democracy?</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by <a href="http://bugcrowd.com/">BugCrowd</a>, big thanks to them.</p>
<p>We'll be chatting with BugCrowd head honcho Casey Ellis all about the skills shortage in infosec, particularly in testing. People interested in a career in infosec are using platforms like BugCrowd as a proving ground, but will that pipeline be enough to satiate the demand for talent out there?</p>
