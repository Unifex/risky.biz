<p>Risky Business, your weekly security podcast, is back! I took a week off to go to Kiwicon in Wellington, and you'll be hearing plenty of material from there over the next few weeks, so if you missed the event, don't stress.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Big thanks to our hosting provider Vigabyte for providing the bandwidth for ITRadio.com.au's podcasts, and of course big hugs for our sponsor, Verizon Business Security Solutions.</p>
<p>On this week's show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Munir Kotadia from ZDNet Australia joins us with the week's news</li>
<li>Sheep fancier Nick Breese explains how to crack passwords with a Playstation 3. Elcomsoft eat your heart out!</li>
<li>Verizon Business Security Solutions' James McMahon joins us to explain why hackers who attend events like Kiwicon aren't necessarily devil-worshiping cyber-terrorists</li>
