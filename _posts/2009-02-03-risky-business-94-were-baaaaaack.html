<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by Sophos and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we ease back into the year by chatting with Neohapsis founder and CTO Greg Shipley about the ineffectiveness of security technologies and the rise of DLP.</p>
<p>Munir Kotadia stops by with this week's news, and Paul Ducklin from Sophos talks Conficker.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the CERT advisory on Autorun mentioned in the news, you can find it <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/889747" target="new">here</a>.</p>
<p>And while it's not mentioned in the show, there's an interesting PDF the team at GOVCERT.NL put together on the md5 SSL thing. Grab it <a href="http://www.govcert.nl/download.html?f=124" target="new">here</a>.</p>
