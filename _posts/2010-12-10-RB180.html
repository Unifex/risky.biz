<p>This is the last Risky Business podcast for 2010, and it's a cracker!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In it we take a look at three things that shaped the information security news agenda in 2010 -- Stuxnet, Wikileaks and the resulting militarisation of the Internet.</p>
<p>We also look back on a year of UNIX-beard-guy news with Adam Boileau.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this special edition -- we'll be back in February 2011!</p>
