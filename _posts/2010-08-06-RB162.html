<p>On this week's show chat to H D Moore about his research into the security -- or lack thereof -- of the VxWorks embedded operating system.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>H D did a presentation at the Security B-Sides event that ran concurrently with Black Hat in Las Vegas. As it turns out VxWorks is used in a lot of places and the people who put it together suck at maths.</p>
<p>People who suck at maths write bad hashing algos. Really.</p>
<p>We'll also have a chat with Ron Gula of Tenable Network Security in this week's sponsor interview, and of course, Adam Boileau stops by for a chat about the week's news headlines.</p>
