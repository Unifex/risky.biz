<p>On this week's show we're talking Near Field Communications (NFC) with New Zealand's Nick von Dadelszen. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>NFC is set to become the next big thing for micropayments, alas it looks likely there's potential to conduct all sorts of mischief using NFC-equipped mobile phones like Google's Nexus S.</p>
<p>NFC equipped phones are RFID readers, and Nick reckons we're about six months away from being able to use them as card emulators as well. Let the fun begin!</p>
<p>Also this week, RSA Australia's Mason Hooper joins us to discuss Apple's decision to expel vulnerability researcher Charlie Miller from its developer program. Miller had snuck a dodgy app into the company's official appstore that was capable of running unsigned arbitrary code. Nice trick. Apple unimpressed. But did they overreact? That's this week's sponsor interview.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, of course, is this week's news guest.</p>
