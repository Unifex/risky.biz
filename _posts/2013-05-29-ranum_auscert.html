<p>The following is a recording of Marcus Ranum's AusCERT keynote speech on CYBER WAR. Marcus was doing the circuit a few years ago with a talk titled "Cyber war is bullshit", which I think makes clear his position, but this one is titled Never Fight a Land War in Cyberspace. He basically argues that the application of traditional military thinking to the cyber domain is flawed. He also argues there's a massive money and power grab taking place as the military and the private sector defence base tries to set the agenda so it can profit from it. It's a really worthwhile talk, and delivered with typical MjR flair. Enjoy.</p>
