<p>F-secure flew its chief research officer, Mikko Hypponen, out to Australia last week to meet the press. The company hosted an event -- the F-Secure Future of the Digital Economy Forum -- and invited a bunch of very interesting panellists to discuss the state of information security today. They asked Risky Business to moderate and record the session.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The panellists were: </p>
<ul>
<li>Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer, F-Secure</li>
<li>Graham Ingram, managing director of AusCERT</li>
<li>Neil Gaughan, national manager of the Australian Federal Police's High Tech Crime Operations</li>
<li>Nick Abrahams, national leader of Deacons' technology, media &amp; telecommunications group</li>
<li>Michael Lonie, policy manager for the Australian Retailers Association</li>
<li>Crispin Tristram, consumer online general manager for Singtel Optus</li>
</ul>
<p>In the interests of disclosure, Risky Business was paid to moderate and record this event.</p>
<p>It was a genuinely interesting discussion, and we're podcasting the whole thing, more or less unedited. So here it is -- last Wednesday's F-Secure future of the digital economy forum, held at the ocean room at Sydney's overseas passenger terminal at Circular Quay West. Enjoy.</p>
