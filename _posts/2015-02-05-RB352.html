<p>In this week's feature we're chatting with Dave Aitel of Immunity Inc. We chat to him about the Sony hack being a demonstration of North Korean capability as opposed to genuine revenge... we also talk about security conferences in 2015 and chat to him about his rage-inspiring musings on so-called junk hacking from last year.</p>

<p>In this week's sponsor interview we speak with HackLabs big cheese Chris Gatford about the so-called Ghost vulnerability.</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was a bit of a fizzer, but it's still an interesting bug from a management point of view. How the hell do you figure out what the impact of something like that is on your network? The gethostbyname code is, of course, all over your nix boxes, but it's no doubt statically included in a whole bunch of your enterprise crapware as well. And the thing is, the fact that it's causing heart palpitations out there in some enterprise teams proves one thing: We don't trust out upstream software providers to patch this stuff... we don't even trust them to know what code is in their own products! It's a contemporary pickle and Chris Gatford of Hacklabs will be along in a bit to discuss it.</p>
