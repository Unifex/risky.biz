<p>The idea was simple. We'd install a bunch of anti-virus products and see who could modify existing viruses to sneak them past detection engines. There'd be beer and banter, a fun afternoon. It wasn't really a scientific contest -- most of the functionality of the scanners was actually turned off. We'd only test the CLI-based signature and heuristic components of the suites.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>I'm one of those poor, poor souls who's been forced to repeatedly deploy appalling, sub-standard, anti-virus shit in enterprise environments over the last few years. Sick of trying to fight a virtual wildfire armed only with the IT equivalent of a warm leaf of lettuce, my friend Rich and I decided to stage <a href="http://racetozero.net" target="new">RaceToZero</a> as a form of protest. </p>
<p>We'd show the world just how awful antivirus software had become. The world would finally understand our pain.</p>
<p>When we announced the contest, some AV commentators and journalists went virtually lost their minds. The first RaceToZero contest, held at DEFCON XVI in Las Vegas last year, was indeed a tad on the controversial side.</p>
<p>Some commentators seemingly expected the headless horseman of the Apocalypse to come riding through the casino when the contest began. Kasperky antivirus founder and CEO Eugene Kaspersky <a href="http://www.viruslist.com/en/weblog?weblogid=208187517" target="new">actually compared the Race To Zero with bank robbery and the distribution of narcotics to children</a>. In the minds of some, we were showing the bad guys how to do stuff they couldn't have learned on their own.</p>
<p>Others were a tad friendlier. They saw RaceToZero for what it was -- a bit of fun designed to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of signature-based antivirus technology as a sole method of defence against modern threats.</p>
<p>Either way, we didn't expect the publicity we got last year. In the words of George Carlin, the whole thing turned into a "huge, prick-waving dick fight". A circus, if you will.</p>
<p>So we're doing it again.</p>
<p>To live up to our critics we had planned a <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/05/07/1559238" target="new">HERF gun</a> making contest (hai2EugeneK) but decided on slipping viruses past AV products again instead. The friendly team from <a href="http://offensivecomputing.net" target="new">OffensiveComputing.net</a> provided the samples we used last year and this year will be taking over the running of the competition.</p>
<p>RaceToZero is still my baby, but I'm happy to send it off to temporary but loving foster care.</p>
<p>OffensiveComputing.net's extensive knowledge of malware, reverse engineering and all things anti* will definitely lift the contest to another level. It won't be as half-assed as last year, (it's more likely to be fully-assed) and may actually produce some results that can be seen as  useful benchmarking for endpoint security products.</p>
<p>The Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization (AMTSO) has <a href="http://www.amtso.org/documents/cat_view/13-amtso-principles-and-guidelines.html" target="new">published guidelines</a> for dynamic testing and RaceToZero will stick to them.</p>
<p>That means getting all fancy and scientific. As much fun as the last contest was, we didn't really prove much. This time we're trying to create a methodology that might actually tell the people responsible for buying endpoint security something useful, like which products did better.</p>
<p>That's right, vendors, you really should be scared now. We're going to empirically show the world how useless you are, instead of just heavily implying it.</p>
<p>While this balanced, unbiased testing of behavioural AV engines is happening, there will be a live scoreboard so that contestants and spectators alike can see how well the teams are doing and how effective each engine is at detecting the threats.</p>
<p>Another upgrade to the contest is automated unpacking and analysis of samples submitted by contestants, which will be validated against the contest guidelines.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks more information will become available on the RaceToZero Website and the <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=433" target="new">DEFCON Forums</a>, we look forward to seeing all past and future contestants in Vegas again this year!</p>
