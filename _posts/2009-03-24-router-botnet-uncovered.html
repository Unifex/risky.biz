<p>The group claims the botnet has been targeting DroneBL's servers in a denial-of-service campaign for several weeks and is the first of its kind. It uses brute-force password cracking attempts to hijack any Linux mipsel routing device that uses insecure or common username and password pairs.</p>

<p>"This is the first known botnet based on exploiting consumer network devices, such as home routers and cable/dsl modems," the DroneBL team wrote in a post on their Website. "Action must be taken immediately to stop this worm before it grows much larger." </p>
