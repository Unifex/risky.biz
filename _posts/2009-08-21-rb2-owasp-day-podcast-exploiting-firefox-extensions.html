<p>In this special interview you'll hear our New Zealand correspondent Paul Craig interviewing Security-Assessment.com's Roberto Suggi Liverani and Nick Freeman discuss their research into exploiting Firefox extensions.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>These guys were doing a review of a large web application and evaluation of a related firefox extension was in scope.</p>
<p>Skype extensions, search toolbars -- all those extensions that people routinely install into their browsers, well, it turns out a lot of them are buggy as hell and these two have figured out how to exploit these little suckers, and at best guess, there's around 30 million boxes out there vulnerable to the extension bugs they've identified.</p>
