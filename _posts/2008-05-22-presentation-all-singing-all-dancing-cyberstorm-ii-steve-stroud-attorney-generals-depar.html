<p>In this quick AusCERT presentation, the Australian Attorney General Department's Steve Stroud talks about Cyberstorm II -- the global cyber war game. Cyberstorm is a full-scale war game involving governments and private sector organisations from Canada, USA, Australia, Britain and New Zealand. It's designed to test the resilience of our infrastructure under a full blown cyber attack.</p>
