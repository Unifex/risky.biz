<p>In this podcast you'll hear me speaking with Assurance.com.au's Neal Wise about the seven deadly sins of mobility. Neal's a penetration tester and a complete and utter wireless nerd. He's a regular on the show and as it turns out he's a standby speaker for this year's AusCERT conference. If anyone winds up too hungover on Wednesday to speak, Neal will step in.</p>

<p>You'll have most likely heard that Google has been busted collecting payload data from wireless networks as its vans drove around doing Google Street view videos... so I asked Neal for his take on that also. Enjoy.</p>
