<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by Sophos.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>And what a show it is! We've got the exclusive podcast interview with HD Moore, who fills us in on the acquisition of the Metasploit project by Rapid7.</p>
<p>Now, before you GPL freaks run to the shed to dig out the pitchforks and flaming torches, you should hear this interview. The way HD describes it, this acquisition is about the best thing that could have happened to Metasploit.</p>
<p>Rapid7's director of products and operations, Corey Thomas, also joins the show with some soothing words for anyone with concerns about the acquisition.</p>
<p>We're also joined this week by Adam Boileau, who discusses the week's news headlines, and Paul Ducklin of Sophos joins us for the week's sponsor interview.</p>
