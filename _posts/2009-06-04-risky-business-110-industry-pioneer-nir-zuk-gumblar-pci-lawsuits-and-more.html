<p>This week's show is hosted by Vigabyte and brought to you by Sophos.  </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we chat to an industry pioneer, Nir Zuk. He's widely credited as the creator of the first stateful inspection firewall.</p>
<p>These days he works for the company he founded, Palo Alto Networks. We're chatting to Nir about his thoughts on security technologies -- everything from firewalls to IDS to DLP. </p>
<p>Nir is a very sharp cat indeed, with a lot to say about the direction security tech is headed. He tends to push his own agenda a bit in terms of talking up his firewall approach, but he has heaps of interesting stuff to say on other topics.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Paul Ducklin about an old debate -- is open source better for security? It was a topic we touched on briefly in the AusCERT speed debate, which, incidentally, is available for download in our <a href="http://risky.biz/netcasts/auscert/rb2-auscert-podcast-loltastic-speed-debating" target="new">Risky Business 2</a> channel. We both thought it was a topic worth expanding on. It's an interesting chat and it's coming up soon.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau is the week's news guest.</p>
