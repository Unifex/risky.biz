<p>SCADA systems and security. Your weekly Australian IT security podcast, Risky Business, is now available for download, with thanks to our sponsor Cybertrust and hosting partner Vigabyte.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>As regular listeners know, this podcast is recorded on Mondays. Due to the long weekend here in Australia, we've had to trim the show a bit this week. But don't worry -- we've got a great interview with Washington heavyweight Marcus Sachs, and we'll also check in with David Shaw from our sponsor Cybertrust.</p>
<p>I'll also do my best impersonation of a news reader while covering this week's headlines.</p>
