<p>In this week's feature we chat to Patrick Webster about his tangle with First State Superannuation.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This is a story we've covered on the show over the last few weeks. If you haven't heard what happened, Pat spotted a bug in First State Super's statements system, probed it, let them know 12 hours later and then wound up with the police on his door!</p>
<p>Since then the whole saga has turned into a pretty big deal here in Australia. The police and civil actions against Webster have both been dropped and First State Super -- and its administrator -- has wound up in a bunch of trouble.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with Tenable CEO Ron Gula about a recent edict from the Securities and Exchange Commission in the USA that advises companies on what sort of cyber risks and incidents they should be disclosing in their quarterly filings. Ron has an interesting take -- initially I disagreed with him but he won me over, I hope you'll stick around for that.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau joins the show, as usual to discuss the week's news.</p>
