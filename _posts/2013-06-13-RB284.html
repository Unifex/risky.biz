<p>In this week's feature interview we chat with author and speaker Richard Thieme about what they used to call the generation gap. NSA leaker Edward Snowden is "Internet generation". Are the ideals espoused by people like Snowden rooted in counter-cultural ideals or are they just generational norms? </p>

<p>Are these ideas around online liberty becoming mainstream? Now that we have so many gen-Ys and millennials actually running the information infrastructure that powers our institutions, could we be on the cusp of serious changes in the way the establishment works? That is an interesting chat.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we're chatting to John Vecchi, Solera's VP of Product Strategy, all about whether or not we're neglecting mundane threats because we're so focussed on identifying APT. </p>
<p>Adam Boileau joins us for this week's news segment. Show notes, including links to the articles discussed, can be found <a href="http://risky.biz/RB284_notes" target="new">here</a>.</p>
