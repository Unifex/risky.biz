<p>This week's show looks back over the key events and trends of 2013; how media focus shifted from focussing on China's cyber-espionage to the scandalous revelations of the Snowden leaks.</p>
<p>We also take a quick look at the Silk Road bust, say goodbye to some friends and check in with <a href="http://insomniasec.com/">Insomnia Security's</a> Brett Moore in this week's sponsor interview.</p>
