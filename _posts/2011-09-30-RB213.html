<p>There's no feature interview in this week's show, instead we're focussing on news instead!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>And what a week it's been.</p>
<p>Browser makers have slayed the SSL BEAST attacks, Goldman Sachs' CEO got dox'd, as did Sgt. Douchebag of the NYPD. You know the one... he's the guy who maced a bunch of peaceful protestors in the face. </p>
<p>Microsoft even got in on the action and dox'd the operator of the Kelihos botnet!</p>
<p>Meanwhile if you're a Cisco admin you're likely having a tough week, as are the folks at Diebold, who apparently STILL can't make secure e-voting machines.</p>
<p>Also this week, Tenable Network CEO Ron Gula joined us to talk about log analysis. Sounds dry, but it's not. This week's show is, of course, sponsored by Tenable!</p>
