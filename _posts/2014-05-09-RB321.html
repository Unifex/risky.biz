<p>On this week's show we're chatting with Silvio Cesare about his new pastime of messing around with home alarm systems, garage door remotes and car immobilisers. How secure do you think your little key ring transmitters are? Well, not very. But the interesting thing is, the tools that you need to crack these things are now very cheap -- could we see thieves roaming the streets with software defined radios, opening up your neighbourhood's garages? Tune in to find out</p>

<p>This week's show is brought to you by HackLabs, an Australian penetration testing and security consulting firm. HackLabs head honcho Chris Gatford joins us in this week's sponsor interview to have a yarn about inadvertent disclosures.</p>
<p>It seems every week we're reading another story about sensitive information being uploaded to a web accessible directory and indexed by Google. It's true that there's no cure for stupid, but is there anything we can do to stop these things happening? </p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins the show to discuss the week's security news.</p>
