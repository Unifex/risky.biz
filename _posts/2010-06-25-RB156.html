<p>In this week's show we have a chat with iDefense threat analyst Kimberly Zenz.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Apparently Russian cybercrooks love to use ICQ, so US-based investigators are <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3333e36e-78a7-11df-a312-00144feabdc0.html" target="new">worried about the planned sale of ICQ</a> to a Russia-based company called Digital Sky.</p>
<p>Kimberly's specialty is the Russian cybercrime scene, and apparently this mooted sale is interesting for a number of reasons. She joins the show to explain!</p>
<p>Adam Boileau is this week's news guest, and Vitaly Kamlyuk of Kaspersky Labs is this week's sponsor guest. In it we discuss the number of malware samples with valid authenticode signatures that are popping up. </p>
<p>With a system this loose is there actually a point to signing code?</p>
