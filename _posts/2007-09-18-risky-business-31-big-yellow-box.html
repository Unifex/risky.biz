<p>Your first "Patrick goes on holiday" version of Risky Business is available for download. An extra special thanks to our hosting partner Vigabyte this week. They've been having to deal with ridiculous amounts of traffic on our behalf, and the server hasn't skipped a beat -- thanks guys!</p>

<p>This week's show was cut together from Symantec's Vision user conference in Sydney. ITRadio caught up with Vincent Weafer, the global director of the company's security response unit. Peter Tippett, Vice President at Verizon Business Security Solutions, our sponsor, is also along this week, discussing the science of quantifying risk.</p>
