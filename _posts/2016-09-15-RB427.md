We have a great feature interview this week. Risky Business contributor Brian Donohue spoke with Cahill law firm partner
Brad Bondi about the suit St Jude Medical has brought against MedSec and Muddy Waters over the short-sell of the medical
device manufacturer's shares. That is an illuminating chat that certainly gave me an understanding of where this all
could be heading, both in terms of the upcoming trial and how likely it is we'll see similar stuff in the future.

This week's show is brought to you by Cylance! These guys basically offer an AV solution that works differently. But you 
know what? I've asked a dozen people what they actually do, and no one has really been able to tell me. So, I talk to
Cylance founder and CEO Stuart McClure about the fall out from the House Oversight report into the OPM breach -- a 
report that went in to some detail on Cylance's role in determining the extent of the breach -- but I also talk to him
more generally about what it is that Cylance actually does.

Adam Boileau is back in the news chair this week to talk about the week's information security headlines.

Oh, and do add [Patrick](https://twitter.com/riskybusiness) or [Adam](https://twitter.com/metlstorm) on Twitter if that's your thing.
