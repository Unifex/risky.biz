<p>This week's feature guest is the creator of the iPhone worm, Ashley Towns, aka Ikee. This guy is either a cheeky kid or a cyber terrorist, depending on who you ask, and yup -- we've got him on the show.</p>

<p>We also check in with Paul Ducklin of Sophos in this week's sponsor interview. You've never heard two interviews that clash more, it's hilarious. </p>
<p>In one corner is the heavily pierced kid from Wollongong with the funny haircut, in the other is the middle aged AV guy who's a real stickler for the rules. </p>
<p>It's the naughty kid versus the school principal, both interviewed about the same series of events. </p>
<p>We're also joined by Adam Boileau for a discussion of the week's news.</p>
