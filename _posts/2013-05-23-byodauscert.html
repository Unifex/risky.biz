<p>The following is a recorded presentation from AusCERT. It's by Al Blake, the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. In it he talks about BYOD, basically, from an Australian government perspective. It's not an overly technical talk, but it is a good overview of what a CIO like him has to consider when allowing staff to use their own devices in a heavily regulated environment.</p>
