<p>This week's podcast is sponsored by RSA Security and hosted by Vigabyte. With the prize money at CanSecWest's PWN2OWN competition hitting $20k, we thought we'd take a look at the vulnerability marketplace. Are the days of full and free disclosure over? Insomnia Security's Brett Moore joins us to talk about it.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Risky Business also caught up with AusCERT's Mark McPherson. While AusCERT is putting on an executive program at its conference this year, we had to ask if security really is a boardroom issue.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview RSA's Geoff Noble talks 2FA -- apparently tokens and SMS are old hat.</p>
<p>On this week's show:</p>

<li>ZDNet Australia editor Munir Kotadia discusses the week's headlines</li>
