<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by a tiny little company called Microsoft, and we'll be taking an in-depth look at some widely reported security issues with WPA TKIP.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>While reports of the death of WPA have been greatly exaggerated, the issues discovered by Erik Tews and Martin Beck are certainly worth a closer look. Can the new capability of attackers to inject seven packets into your WPA network lead to a total compromise? Will this research open the floodgates and lead to more serious issues being uncovered?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.assurance.com.au/" target="new">Assurance.com.au's</a> Neal Wise joins us to discuss. Neal is a real WiFi nut and he's been up to his armpits in this stuff since the reports first surfaced.</p>
<p>We'll also check in with Adam Boileau for a chat about the last week's news headlines: Did you read about Google's incredibly daft Android security lapse yet? Holy smokes!</p>
<p>Microsoft's Peter Watson will also swing by for this week's sponsor interview. This week we chat to Peter about the security of cloud computing.</p>
