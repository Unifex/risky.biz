<p>This week's show is sponsored by <a href="http://tenable.com/" target="new">Tenable Network Security. </a></p>
<p>Tenable's chief executive Ron Gula will be along in this week's sponsor interview to chat about the theft of Symantec's source code. He doesn't think it's a world ender, and you know what, he's probably right! He's along after this week's feature interview.</p>
<p>There's also plenty of news to discuss with our news co-host Adam Boileau!</p>
