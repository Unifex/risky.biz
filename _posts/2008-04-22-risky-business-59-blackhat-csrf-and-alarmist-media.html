<p>This week's show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show Risky Business guest Jeremiah Grossman -- Whitehat Security founder and <a href="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/">blogger</a> -- discusses Cross Site Request Forgery attacks with host Patrick Gray. CSRF attacks are no longer a lab attack folks, they're in the wild. Jeremiah shares his insights with us.</p>
<p>Infosec fixture Ron Gula, the co-founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.tenablesecurity.com" target="new">Tenable Network Security</a>, pops by in this week's sponsor interview to discuss his company's moves into the SIEM market and recap the company's move to take Nessus closed source. It's been a few years since that happened -- how did it all end up?</p>
<p>In this week's news segment, Patrick Gray rants about the Australian media's <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/bosses-power-to-check-email/2008/04/13/1208024990775.html" target="new">God-awful reporting</a> of sensible comments made by Attorney-General Robert McClelland. The sensationalist tabloid bug is evidently <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;81561031" target="new">contagious</a>, because it's been sweeping the Aussie media over the last week.</p>
