<p>This week's show is brought to you by Check Point Software.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's show is a bit of a mixed bag. We chatted with 451 group analyst Paul Roberts live from the floor at the RSA conference in San Francisco. Then for something completely different we quizzed Adam Pointon about his adventures with X10 home automation equipment. </p>
<p>Check Point Australia's Steve MacDonald is this week's sponsor guest, and Adam Boileau was this week's news guest.</p>
