<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this podcast you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll hear Gutmann\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fascinating keynote presentation at the Kiwicon security conference, held in November at Victoria University in Wellington.</p>
<p>Gutmann is well known in crypto circles \xe2\u20ac\u201d he co-wrote PGP 2.0 in the early 90s \xe2\u20ac\u201d and in this talk he argues the human brain was not built with data security in mind.</p>
<p>This podcast is part one of his talk. You can download part two <a href="http://www.itradio.com.au/security/wp-content/uploads/RB44.mp3" target="new">here</a>, or you can wait until I push out part two as a separate podcast in a couple of days.</p>
