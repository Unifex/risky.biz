<p>Senator Scott Ludlam of the Greens party is the only Australian politician kicking up a stink about the government's metadata retention bill. And we're glad about that, it's a pretty defective bill, even if some recent amendments recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) have made it much more palatable.</p>

<p>Scott was passing through my town last week campaigning on behalf of the local Greens state election candidate for Ballina -- the NSW election is coming up at the end of March. So, we caught up and did this interview all about the latest with the bill and the politics behind it.</p>
<p>The Green's full metadata video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mupzb2ySpWQ" target="new">here</a>.</p>
