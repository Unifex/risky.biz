<p>This week's show will feature part two of my interview with convicted spy Christopher Boyce. He went on a one man mission to damage his country's military and intelligence apparatus in the 70s. He says he did it because the US was undermining the democratically elected government of Australia. </p>

<p>So this week we go back to the 70s with Chris Boyce to chat about the Whitlam years. Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam lost government in 1975 when the Australian senate blocked budget supply and caused a shutdown of the federal government. Sound familiar? That's coming up after the news.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you Adobe, and man, they've had a rough week. We don't have Brad Arkin in this week's sponsor slot because he's busy dealing with a crisis over there, but we DO have an interview with Karthik Raman, a security researcher at Adobe who'll be talking about how Adobe runs its secure product lifecycle program.</p>
<p>Mark Piper is filling in for Adam Boileau in this week's news segment. Find links to what we discuss <a href="http://risky.biz/RB299_notes">here</a>.</p>
