<p>This is a sponsor interview with Marc Eisenbarth, Arbor Networks' security architect and the manager of research for its Arbor Security Engineering and Response Team (ASERT).</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>I spoke to Mark about the massive influx of NTP-based DDoS traffic we've seen this year. Can we expect attackers to move on to other protocols and services like SNMP and Chargen? He thinks so. But it's not until we start seeing SNMP-based DDoS capabilities built into generic malware that we'll really have big problems.</p>
