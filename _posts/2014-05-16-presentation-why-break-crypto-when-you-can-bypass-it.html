<p>You're about to hear a recording of Peter Gutmann's speech here which is all about crypto. Well, it's sort of about crypto. With newspapers filled with stories about the NSA subverting crypto standards, Peter asks us whether that really matters. Why would an attacker bother breaking crypto when they can just bypass it?</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Peter is well positioned to do this talk. He's a researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Auckland and works on the design and analysis of cryptographic security architectures and security usability. </p>
<p>He helped write PGP, has authored a number of papers and RFC's on security and encryption, and is the author of the open source cryptlib security toolkit. And luckily for us, he's a fairly regular guest on Risky Business.</p>
