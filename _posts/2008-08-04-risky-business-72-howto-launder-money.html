<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by the fine folks at RSA Security.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's podcast, Risky Business takes a look at an area that impacts the IT security business that surprisingly few infosec professionals know a great deal about: Money laundering.</p>
<p>With recent news of eGold directors agreeing to plead guilty to money laundering charges in the USA, we thought it would make sense to look at how money gets from A to B in the underground. And once it's there, how is it turned into cold, hard cash?</p>
<p>iDefense Senior Threat Analyst Kimberly Zenz joins us on the line from the USA to discuss. Don't worry, she's not one of those vendor people who just claims to know a lot about this stuff, she's the real deal.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau is this week's news guest, and Greg Singh from RSA Security drops in to discuss dodgy package and software update managers in this week's sponsor interview.</p>
