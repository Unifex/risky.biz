<p>This week's show is brought to you by RSA Security and hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We've got two feature interviews this week. The first story in this week's show is an interview with BreakingPoint Systems' Dennis Cox. He's been playing around with TCP Denial of Service attacks for something like 12 years, and he's got a few insights into this latest DoS that some researchers from a Swedish company are saying will melt the Internet.</p>
<p>We'll also chat about a new type of Trojan -- which uses WMI event filters and consumers -- unveiled at the Kiwicon security conference in Wellington. MacLeonard Starkey from AusCERT will be along to talk about that one.</p>
<p>This week's sponsor interview is with Greg Singh of RSA Security. With world markets in a tailspin, layoffs are sure to follow. What can we do to make sure disgruntled ex employees don't make a bad situation worse?</p>
