<p>You're about to hear a presentation by Jason Larsen, a security researcher at the Idaho National Laboratory.  The INL is run by the US Department of Energy and is home to the National SCADA Testbed (NSTB) and the Industrial Control System CERT(ICS-CERT). </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>I'm going to read from his talk synopsis here: The first half of Jason's presentation will be an overview and update on what\u2019s happening in control. In most cases, simply sending properly formatted commands to the field equipment is enough, but there are cases when this does not achieve the attacker\u2019s goals.  If the field equipment contains sanity checks, the attacker needs sub-second control, or if he simply wants to hide, he will invade the field equipment. Understanding the challenges the attacker faces are essential for any sort of investigative or forensics effort. The second part of the presentation will cover attack and forensics of the embedded systems used in industrial control systems.</p>
<p>We were a couple of minutes late plugging into the desk, so we'll pick up Jason's talk just a few minutes in.</p>
