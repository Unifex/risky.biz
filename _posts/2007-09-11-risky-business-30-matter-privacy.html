<p>This week's installment of Risky Business -- your weekly Australian IT security podcast -- is now available for download, thanks to our sponsor, Verizon Business Security Solutions. It's a short show this week, and you'll notice Risky Business will be a bit trimmed down over coming weeks. That's because Patrick Gray is going on holidays, but don't worry, there are some pre-recorded shows that'll be published each Tuesday as usual.</p>

<ul>
<li>On this week's show Patrick chats to Gartner analyst Andrew Walls about proposed amendments to the Federal Privacy Act that could have serious consequences for IT security pros.</li>
<li>ZDNet Australia's Munir Kotadia will also be along to discuss the week's news headlines.</li>
