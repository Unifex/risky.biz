<p>In this edition of RB2 you'll hear Paul Craig's Kiwicon 3 presentation, Hacking Scientists. As you'll hear, Paul has developed some fuzzing methodologies that he's applied to scientific software. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This sort of software -- chemistry stuff, fluid dynamics stuff etc -- is used by weapons designers, pharmaceutical engineers, car manufacturers and all sorts of very interesting people. </p>
<p>In other words, this software is found on the same systems as the world's most valuable IP. It's good stuff to find bugs in.</p>
<p>You might recognise Paul's voice -- in addition to working for Security-Assessment.com he's a regular contributor to the RB2 podcast. Enjoy!</p>
