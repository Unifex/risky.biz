<p>On this week's show we're taking a look at basic opsec with an incident responder friend of ours. We'll be talking about some sensible strategies people can use when they're up to illegal stuff on the Internets, because, you know, watching all these guys getting busted for owning FBI websites from their own IPs is getting boring. </p>
