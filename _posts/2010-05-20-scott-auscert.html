<p>In this presentation you'll hear Scott McIntyre talking about maintaining proportionality when dealing with matters of digital security.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Scott's the Chief Security Officer for Dutch ISP XS4all and serves on the board of directors for the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, or FIRST.</p>
<p>In this talk Scott argues that all the FUD out there is leading to over regulation. He also argues that CSIRT teams and incident handlers actually cause some security failures and that understanding the far reaching consequences to our actions is critical if we're ever going to have a safe Internet experience for the masses.</p>
