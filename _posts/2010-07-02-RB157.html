<p>WARNING: This week we missed some bad language during the edit... so hide this filthy podcast from your children's innocent ears.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we're chatting with the head of Australia's Internet Industry Association (IIA), Peter Coroneos, about the government's plan to force internet users here to use antivirus software or be kicked off the tubes!</p>
<p>Peter was the architect of Australia's just released voluntary code for ISPs, but he'll be along soon to talk about why he thinks regulation here is actually a BAD idea. That's coming up soon.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Tenable Network Security CEO Ron Gula about APTs, or Advanced Persistent Threats. Are APTs a big deal? Are they real? Is this marketing hype? What's going on?</p>
<p>That's this week's sponsor interview, and it's coming up later.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins the show to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
