<p>In this week's show we take a look at the big burning issue of BYOD. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Neal Wise of Assurance.com.au joins us to discuss some common approaches. Neal says one reason companies are starting to address the issue is because staff are already bringing devices in and connecting them to corporate resources regardless of company policy. In other words it's happening whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security -- if you need some vulnerability detection and management software, or some whiz bang security information event management kit, you'd best get your butt into gear and head to <a href="http://www.tenable.com/" target="new">tenable.com</a>.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview Tenable Network Security CEO Ron Gula also weighs in on the debate. He says the BYOD phenomenon is doing a fantastic job at resuscitating NAC and NAP vendors.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins us for this week's news headlines.</p>
