<p>In this week's show we speak with TrustedSec CEO Dave Kennedy about his testimony to the US congress about the Obama administration's healthcare.gov website. It cost over $600m and it's riddled with infosec 101 bugs. We find out just how bad it is and what can be done about it.</p>

<p>This week's show is brought to you by Senetas, makers of fine, fine layer 2 encryption software. In this week's sponsor interview we speak with Senetas CTO and co-founder Julian Fay about the sudden popularity of the layer 2 crypto gear they've been selling for something like 15 years. Have the Snowden revelations actually changed things for encryption companies? Julian says yes, big time, in a tangible way.</p>
