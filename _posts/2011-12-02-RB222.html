<p>I thought we'd just have a bit of a fun feature for the last show of the year. It's an interview with Edith Cowan University's Peter Hannay about a presentation he did at Ruxcon back in 2010, all about turning Amazon's Kindle into a completely free internet access device that works all over the world. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>That's right, no subscriber fees and 3G access in a zillion countries. </p>
<p>He'll tell you how you can hack your kindle to use it as a completely free USB Internet access device pretty much anywhere in the world. No more data roaming for you! W00t w00t! SSH everywhere!</p>
<p>Astaro's Angelo Comazzetto takes a look back on Sony's 2011 woes in this week's sponsor interview and Adam Boileau joins us, as always, to discuss the week's news.</p>
<p>Peter Hannay's Kindle code can be found <a href="http://openduck.com/2010/11/27/hooray-for-reading-hacking-the-kindle/" target="new">here</a>.</p>
