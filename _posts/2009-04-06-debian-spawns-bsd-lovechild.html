<p>The move seems to be an attempt to offer the BSD kernel within the Debian Linux userland environment. Users who install Debian's FreeBSD kernel will be able to use the BSD packet filter, pf, as well as other BSD-specific security features like <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail" target="new">jails</a>.</p>

<p>Debian has also claimed BSD is immune from many of the legal challenges facing the Linux operating system. "Linux sources are like a minefield," <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/kFreeBSD_why" target="new">a memo from Debian reads</a>. "kFreeBSD is much less vulnerable to such attacks because of its less bazaar-like development model."</p>
