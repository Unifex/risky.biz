<p>On this week's show we're chatting with CEO of Australia's Internet Industry Association, Peter Coroneos. Peter led the charge for a National 2FA scheme many years ago... it hasn't quite gotten off the ground yet, but Peter joins us shortly to discuss the scheme, how it got started and why it hasn't really gone anywhere yet.</p>

<p>We're also joined by a special guest in our sponsor segment this week, Paul Asadoorian, the host of the PaulDotCom Security Weekly podcast. Paul's dayjob is as Tenable's "Evangelist". He won't be evangelising anything this week though, he's popping by to talk about training. Paul did work for SANS, and we'll be asking Paul what he thinks training and certification are good for.</p>
<p>And we'll be checking the week's news with Adam "metlstorm" Boileau!</p>
