<p>Despite some technical challenges we have a great show for you all this week. We'll be chatting with Mike Ryan of iSec Partners and his pal, independent hardware hacker Joe Fitzpatrick, all about the NSA Playset! It's a hobbyist project that aims to recreate all the awesome tools in the leaked NSA ANT catalogue. Such fun!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We'll also be hearing a tale of cloud woe from the trenches of enterprise IT. A friend of the show had his entire global email infrastructure pulled offline by Symantec with what he says was inadequate warning. And he might just have a point there. Have a listen to the interview and make your own mind up.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by the fine folks at Websense! Websense does Web, email and data security, and this week's sponsoe guest is Neil Thacker, head of information security and strategy for Europe, middle east and africa at Websense. And he's going to tell us that DLP is back baby... it's finding new life for a few reasons... the most interesting of which, I reckon, is as a confirmation tool for detecting when a positive is most definitely not false!</p>
