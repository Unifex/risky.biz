<p>This week we're chatting with the company's vice president of security response, Vincent Weafer. </p>
<p>In this interview, Vincent and I discuss the relative complexity of modern malware. Gone are the days of 214-byte malware that could spread via a single UDP packet. They were good days, but now they're gone and we're dealing with some really diabolically complicated stuff.</p>
<p>But we're still seeing malware that's relatively simple considering its 2010. Gumblar is a good example of that -- it's simple and not particularly sophisticated, but it's been very effective. </p>
<p>So which poses a bigger threat? Simple stuff or complicated stuff?</p>
