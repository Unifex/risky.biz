<p>In the following interview, Microsoft's Steve Adegbite joins me for this interview about the potential for a nanny state operating system.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>With all this rogue AV stuff floating about, the Microsofties are encountering a few fairly significant dilemmas on how to deal with this stuff. Should the OS only accept certain, known brands of AV? Well, then they're acting as a gateway and telling people what they can and can't run. Can't do that. What about a warning system like they did with device drivers? Well, that wasn't much good in the end because people just ignored the warnings.</p>
<p>So what can Microsoft do about this rogue AV problem?</p>
