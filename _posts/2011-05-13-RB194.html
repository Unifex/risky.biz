<p>This week's show was cut together from Johannesburg, South Africa!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In it we discuss Google's latest bug bounty initiative -- they're not just offering cash for bugs in software products, these days they're also offering cash for bugs in their online properties. Got an auth bypass for Gmail? Ka-ching!</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Astaro. Jack Daniel of Astaro joins us to talk about restricting certain content types from SOEs. Do we really need Flash in our operating environments anymore? Can we just drop it and gain some security?</p>
<p>Adam Boileau drops in, as always, to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
