<p>The following is a complete recording of Christopher Hoff's AusCERT presentation. He's the chief security architect with Juniper Networks. He has a vendor-heavy background, but don't hold that against him -- he's got some very interesting ideas around virtualisation, cloud computing and deperimiterisation. His talk is about automating security at scale, but he starts off, off all things, with a history innovation in toilets, which surprisingly works pretty well.</p>
