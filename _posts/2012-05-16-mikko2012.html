<p>It takes him a few minutes to pick up steam, but I definitely recommend sticking with his talk. It starts out good and winds up fascinating. The title of his talk is The Enemy, and in it he examines three groups of attackers -- Criminals, Hacktivists and Nation States. It sounds like well worn material, but <a href="http://conference.auscert.org.au/conf2012/speaker_Mikko_Hypponen.html" target="new">Mikko's take</a> is definitely worth listening to.</p>
