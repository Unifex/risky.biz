<p>In this podcast you'll hear an interview I did with ZScaler's Michael Sutton. In it he expresses frustration that criminals are able to so easily manipulate Google's search results for trending topics. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Sutton claims that malicious pages linked to trending topics are rising through Google's rankings almost immediately. In other words, the bad guys have gotten good at SEO.</p>
<p>But if Sutton and his colleagues can identify these pages from outside Google, why can't Google detect them? It's not exactly short on resources or cash.</p>
