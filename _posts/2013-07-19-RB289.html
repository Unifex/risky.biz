<p>This week's show is brought to you by the fine, fine people at Tenable Network Security, big thanks to Tenable for all its support over the years.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>And on this week's show we chat briefly with South Korean researcher SeungJin Lee about Smart TV security. They're equipped with cameras and microphones and they're popping up in living rooms everywhere.</p>
<p>Now, smart phones have cameras and microphones on them, so a lot of the hype around connected home devices seems a bit unreasonable. It's not like this is the first type consumer device that can be turned into a surveillance device. But as you'll hear, Smart TV operating systems are pretty insecure and vulnerable to some pretty basic forms of exploitation, so some of these concerns are actually quite reasonable.</p>
<p>SeungJin Lee will be dropping in to discuss his research into Smart TV security, research he'll be presenting at BlackHat in Las Vegas the week after next!</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Ron Gula, the CEO of Tenable Network Security. This week we ask Ron if Ed Snowden's revelations on NSA spying could drive non-US companies away from doing business with American cloud service providers.</p>
<p>And we check the week's security news stories with Adam Boileau. Show notes <a href="http://risky.biz/RB289_notes">here</a>.</p>
