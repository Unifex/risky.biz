<p>In this sponsored podcast, Symantec's VP of security response joins RB2 to talk about some novel new approaches to the malware problem.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We don't normally talk to sponsors about their own technology, but this is just where the conversation went, and it's pretty interesting stuff!</p>
<p>Symantec's vision for the future is to gauge the level of risk posed to systems by building up a database that ranks executables according to their reputation. It's sort of like eBay's system of ranking buyers and sellers. I'd heard of this approach a while ago, but Vincent drills down into a bit of detail here. It's good stuff.</p>
