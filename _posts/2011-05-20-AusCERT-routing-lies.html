<p>This podcast is a complete presentation by APNIC's Geoff Huston.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>According to the official synopsis: This presentation will outline the role of addresses and routing and the potential attack vectors, and will also report on the progress to establish a secure framework for addresses and their use in the Internet, highlighting the progress in establishing a secure routing environment for the Internet.</p>
<p>As regular RB listeners would know, we've followed APNIC's work and papers in this area and they have a habit of pushing out good stuff... so this should be a decent talk. Enjoy!</p>
