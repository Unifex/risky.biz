<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is sponsored by Check Point Software Technologies and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we're taking a fresh look at "bulletproof" hosting services. Just last week a California-based hosting company, McColo, was de-peered by its upstream providers for hosting bot net command and control servers. </p>
<p>The result? A 65-75 percent reduction in global spam levels. </p>
<p>We'll talk to iDefense Senior Threat Analyst Kimberly Zenz about the closure of McColo and what the lasting effect -- if there is one -- will be.</p>
<p>This week also sees the triumphant return of Munir Kotadia from <i>ZDNet Australia</i>. Munir drops in to discuss the week's security news.</p>
<p>And Check Point's Engineering Services Manager, Steve MacDonald, pops in for this week's sponsor interview -- the topic is capacity planning.</p>
