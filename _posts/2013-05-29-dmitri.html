<p>Active defence is the new black. It's the issue of 2013. One of the organisations that helped put the issue on to the agenda is CrowdStrike, a business founded by some senior ex technologists from McAfee.

<p>One of CrowdStrike's founders was Dmitri Alperovitch. He was at AusCERT and used his speaking slot to basically deliver the thinking behind CrowdStrike's pitch. It's nothing earth shattering, but it's a really well packaged speech that presents a cogent argument for the concept of active defence. So here it is, Dmitri Alperovitch's AusCERT talk titled Offence as the Best Defence.</p>
