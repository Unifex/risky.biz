<p>This is an interview with Robert Clark, the operational attorney for the US Army Cyber Command. I posted audio of his talk yesterday... he spoke a lot about international law as it applies to cyber war. But I wanted to pick his brains about something he briefly mentioned. </p>

<p>During his presentation he mentioned that espionage is actually legal under international law. I asked him to expand on that and we had a great chat about the legal aspects of online espionage.</p>
