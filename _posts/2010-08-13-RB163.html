<p>This week's show is a cracker -- we're joined by IOActive's Barnaby Jack.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>He made some major waves at BlackHat this year by demonstrating his attacks on ATMs.</p>
<p>He joins the show to discuss his research and talk about why his talk -- which was originally scheduled for last year's BlackHat conference -- was cancelled last year.</p>
<p>Kaspersky Lab's Vitaly Kamlyuk is this week's sponsor guest. He joins us to discuss what AV companies can do to detect some of the more exotic malware out there such as Stuxnet.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, checks in with the week's news headlines.</p>
