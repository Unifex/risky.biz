<p>On this week's show we have a quick chat with The Register's Darren Pauli about XP still being bloody everywhere. You'd think organisations out there would realise how absolutely crackheaded it is to keep running XP since support ended, but nope... Even the police are happily chugging away on perennially vulnerable boxes. Great.</p>

<p>This week's show is brought to you by BugCrowd: outsourced bug bounty programs.</p>
<p>BugCrowd founder and CEO Casey Ellis will be along in this week's sponsor interview to talk about how you can scope a bounty program. If someone does something out of scope should you still pay? It surprised me but Casey says there's a golden rule of thumb in these circumstances -- did you change code? Then pay a bounty.</p>
<p>We also get his thoughts on whether or not a bounty program would have turned up the bug that smashed Tweetdeck last week.</p>
