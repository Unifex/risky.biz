<p>It's been 24 hours since Risky.Biz published a news story about several vulnerabilities -- CSRF and XSS bugs -- found in McAfee's secure vulnerability scanning service.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The story has gone global, with outlets like <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10234033-83.html" target="new">News.com</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/05/mcafee_site_bugs/" target="new">The Register</a> picking it up.</p>
<p>So we got Mike on the phone to discuss his research. As it turns out, McAfee is just the tip of the iceberg. Bailey says this is a much bigger issue affecting most PCI scanning vendors.</p>
