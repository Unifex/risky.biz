<p>The following is a recording of a presentation by Zscaler's Michael Sutton. The topic is Security risks in the next generation of offline Web applications. Basically the talk looks at persistent client side storage, as brought on by stuff like Google Gears and the Database Storage functionality included in HTML5.</p>
