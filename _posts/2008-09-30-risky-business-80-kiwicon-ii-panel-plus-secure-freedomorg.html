<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by Check Point and hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting. Risky Business 80 was recorded at the second annual Kiwicon conference in Wellington, New Zealand.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this podcast, you'll hear the panel I ran at Kiwicon. Panelists were Insomnia Security's Brett Moore, the University of Auckland's Peter Gutmann and Security-Assessment.com's Paul Craig.</p>
<p>You'll also hear an interview with Mark "pipes" Piper about his latest initiative -- secure-freedom.org. It's a site designed to funnel knowledge from corporate security guys into the delicate little brains of open source developers.</p>
<p>This week's sponsor interview features Check Point Software's Steve MacDonald discussing recent changes to Australia's EPL process.</p>
