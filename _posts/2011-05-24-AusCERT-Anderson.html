<p>This is a full presentation by AusCERT's day three keynote speaker Ross Anderson.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Ross has kindly allowed us to podcast his entire talk.</p>
<p>Ross is professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, and author of the bestselling textbook "Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems". He was a pioneer of peer-to-peer systems, of hardware tamper-resistance, and of the economics of information security. </p>
<p>Ross will discuss the economics of information security in two contexts: frauds against payment networks, and the resilience of the Internet. The talk will draw on a recent major study Cambridge did on the resilience of the Internet.</p>
