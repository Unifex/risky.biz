<p>This week's episode is hosted by Vigabyte and brought to you by Tenable Network Security. </p>

<p>On this week's show we're looking back at an issue we covered a little while ago:  PLAID. No, not the oh-so-groovy pattern, but Centrelink's home-baked authentication protocol.</p>
<p>PLAID is a contactless smart card authentication protocol designed by Australia's welfare agency and released a couple of months ago. They're hoping to have it recognised as an ISO standard, but not everyone's convinced that's a good idea.</p>
<p>We'll be hearing from the University of Auckland's Peter Gutmann. He's a bit of a rockstar in the smart card and crypto fields, and he's had a look at the supporting documentation released by Centrelink and isn't too impressed.</p>
<p>It might sound like an Australia-centric story, but it's not. This is a fascinating case-study-in-progress for anyone considering doing this sort of wheel reinvention project. </p>
<p>In this week's sponsor segment we chat to Marcus Ranum about the liability chain when data leaks.</p>
<p>Securus Global's Declan Ingram joined host Patrick Gray at the pub to discuss the week's news headlines. Sorry about the background noise!</p>
