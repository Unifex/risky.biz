<p>This podcast features excerpts from Jose Nazario's session at the GovCERT Symposium in Rotterdam. The recording isn't fantastic, but you can understand what he's saying -- it's clear enough.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Jose works for Arbor networks and his talk at GovCERT was on BGP security -- security issues in core routing. He covers off some pretty interesting stuff, like why isn't there some sort of global route registry that actually authorises routes? Currently there's nothing like that.</p>
<p>If you're not into routing stuff you'll probably get lost with this one, but otherwise you'll likely enjoy it.</p>
