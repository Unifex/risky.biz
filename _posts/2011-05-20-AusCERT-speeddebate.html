<p>You're about to hear one of the highlights of AusCERT's annual conference -- the speed debates! Not to be taken too seriously, the speed debate happens at the end of the con -- it's a chance to have a laugh and shed some lighter perspectives on the security discipline.</p>

<p>It's hosted by Australian broadcaster and journalist Adam Spencer. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
