<p>In this interview we chat with Juniper Networks' chief security architect Christopher Hoff. I posted the audio of Chris's plenary talk yesterday... it was very interesting stuff, so check it out if you get a chance. He basically outlined his vision for security automation -- security at scale.</p>

<p>A part of that vision is advocating a more communication and integration between apps and infrastructure. He says apps should be able to interact directly with networking infrastructure through APIs. It sounds great, but could it be a disaster?</p>
