<p>On this week's show we chat with Silent Circle founder Jon Callas about the decision to shutter the Silent Mail service, as well as what Silent Circle is doing to bolster product security in the wake of some pretty nasty bug disclosures by our pal Mark Dowd.</p>

<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Tenable CEO Ron Gula about innovation trends in infosec -- he was working the trade floor like a boss at BlackHat, so I asked him what tickled his fancy.</p>
<p>A shaken but not stirred Adam Boileau joins us from the earthquake-ravaged, lawless badlands of Wellington to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
