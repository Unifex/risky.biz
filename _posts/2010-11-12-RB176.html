<p>Brian Snow worked for the USA's National Security Agency from 1971 until a few years ago. By the time he retired from the agency he had risen through the ranks to the position of technical director, information assurance.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>He's also one of Risky Business listeners' favourite guests. </p>
<p>This week's show features an in depth conversation with Brian about all sorts of recent trends in the information security area -- Stuxnet, technical debt, surveillance news and more. </p>
<p>It's a cracker interview.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by <a href="http://www.tenablesecurity.com" target="new">Tenable Network Security</a>, and that company's CSO, Marcus Ranum, will be along to give his take on Stuxnet. He says it changes nothing and is not an act of so-called cyber-war. In fact, Marcus says (quite rightly) that there's no proof whatsoever that Stuxnet was the work of a state-run agency.</p>
