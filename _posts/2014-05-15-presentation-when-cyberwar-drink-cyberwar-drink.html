<p>PRESENTATION: When is a cyberwar (drink!) a cyberwar (drink!)?<br/>
Bob Clark returns to AusCERT\u2026</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This is a recording of a presentation by Bob Clark, who these days teaches at the US Naval Academy. He has a long history as a department of defence lawyer including a stint as the counsel for the US Army Cyber Command.</p>
<p>In this talk Bob covers some ground he has covered before -- looking at when an online action represents an act of war under the laws of armed conflict -- but also takes a look at some legal cases in the civilian world involving the CFAA.</p>
