<p>This week's Risky Business podcast is brought to you by MessageLabs, and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show you'll hear some audio from a hearing in the US House of Representatives -- excerpts from the subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology Hearing. That hearing posed the question "Do the Payment Card Industry Data Standards Reduce Cybercrime?"</p>
<p>Apparently they don't.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat to Paul Wood from MessageLabs in the UK about some of the more innovative features in malware these days. Paul's up to his armpits in the stuff, so he has some interesting things to say. </p>
<p>Paul Craig from Security-Assessment.com is this week's news guest.</p>
<p>If you\u2019d like to comment on anything you\u2019ve heard on Risky Business, or suggest something you\u2019d like to hear on the show, you can call Sydney 02 8569 1835 or USA +1 877 688 8417 (Toll free). We'd love to hear from you.</p>
