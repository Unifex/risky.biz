<p>This week's show is a bit of a special edition, prepared at the GovCERT.nl Symposium at the World Trade Centre in Rotterdam, Netherlands. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This isn't a regular edition of the show, so sadly we will not be joined by our regular news guest Adam Boileau for our weekly news segment. Instead, we'll be having a chat with Neohapsis CTO Greg Shipley, who's also here to give his own talk at GovCERT.nl.</p>
<p>Greg's firm actually did some of the forensics work on one of the organisations allegedly attacked by Alberto Gonzalez, the Internet super-villain. If you've been in a cave for the last few months, Gonzalez is the guy who's suspected of stealing up to 135 million credit card numbers over several years... and he's now in prison as a result.</p>
<p>Greg's and I discussed how these sorts of breaches could actually happen in organisations that actually pay attention to their security.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview, Check Point's Engineering Services Manager Steve MacDonald will be along to have a talk about a recent report -- one that we mentioned on last week's show -- that claimed up to nine percent of corporate machines are actually infected with custom-designed malware.</p>
<p>Working for Check Point, Steve has a lot of exposure to large corporate clients, and depressingly, says the report is entirely plausible.</p>
