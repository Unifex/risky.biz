<p>In this edition of the RB2 podcast we're chatting with Declan Ingram from Securus Global about an interesting report that was recently released by analysis house Forrester.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>It was commissioned by Microsoft and was intended to assess the data security practices of North American, European, and Australian enterprises by surveying CISOs.</p>
<p>Forrester sought to understand the value of sensitive information contained in enterprise portfolios; the security controls used to protect this information; the drivers of information security programs; and the cost and impact of enterprise data security incidents. </p>
<p>There were some interesting findings. Among them, that security managers use compliance regimes to justify security spending, not security for security's sake.</p>
