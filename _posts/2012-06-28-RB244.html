<p>There's a lot of really interesting news this week. Adam Boileau is back on deck at the top of the show to discuss shitty security at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, the new tool DroidSheep, DARPA's (DERPA? Lol.) attempts at securing the architectural mess that is Android, dudes going to prison, other dudes getting away with stuff and much, much more!</p>

<p>In this week's feature interview we chat with Matthew D Greene, Assistant Research Professor at Johns Hopkins University's Information Security Institute. We're talking to him about some recently unveiled attacks against hardware tokens that enable attackers to extract key material that's supposed to be protected. Oops!</p>
<p>Matthew blogged about it <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/06/bad-couple-of-years-for-cryptographic.html" target="new">here</a>, and the paper we discuss is <a href="http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/70/47/90/PDF/RR-7944.pdf" target="new">here [pdf]</a>.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by our good friends at <a href="http://sensepost.com/" target="new">SensePost</a>! Sensepost founder and director Charl Van Der Walt will be along in this week's sponsor interview to discuss what he's learned from <a href="http://www.sensepost.com/services/training" target="new">teaching BlackHat courses for 10 years</a>.</p>
