<p>At AusCERT last week I caught up with Phil Piotrowski, a threat researcher with Sophos, as well as Rob Forsyth, a director of Sophos here in Australia.</p>

<p>Really what this chat is all about is interface. We cover a few topics; how users are finding it increasingly difficult to determine when a warning dialogue or popup is genuine or fake, how online crime syndicated are investing a great deal more effort into pretty graphics and good copywriting, and then we chat about how mobile operating systems like Android have succeeded by making extraordinarily complicated things appear very very simple, and what the security implications of that are.</p>
