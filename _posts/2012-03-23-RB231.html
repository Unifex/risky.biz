<p>This week's feature interview is a chat with Verizon Business Security Solutions' Bryan Sartin about the annual Data Breach Investigations Report, or DBIR.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Risky Business covers <a>the report [pdf]</a> every year. </p>
<p>It's basically a post mortem of the previous year -- what sort of records were breached and by who? What were their motivations? What were their techniques?</p>
<p>The US Secret Service cooperates with the report, as does Australia's own Federal Police. When you throw in Verizon's own caseload, you wind up with something approaching an authoritative report. It's rare for a vendor to actually put out something this good.</p>
<p>The 2012 report, which focuses on 2011 incidents, arrived at a very interesting conclusion -- in 2011, more records were breached by hacktivists than criminals. </p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat with RSA Australia's acting country manager Geoff Noble. Geoff normally heads up sales, but don't hold that against him, because as you'll hear he's actually got a deep understanding of trends in enterprise security. </p>
<p>I got Geoff on the phone earlier this week and asked him to tell us what  trends emerged at the most recent RSA conference in San Francisco.</p>
