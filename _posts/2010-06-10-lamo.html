<p>In this week's feature interview we chat with Adrian Lamo. Best known as the "homeless hacker," Lamo is in the news again over his decision to inform on US Army Specialist Bradley Manning, the alleged leaker of the so-called "Collateral Murder" video published by Wikileaks in April. </p>

<p>Manning is now in detention in Kuwait. We ask Lamo why he turned him in.</p>
<p>Also this week, Veracode co-founder and chief scientist Christien Rioux joins the show to talk about some fresh approaches to information security and cloud computing in our sponsor interview. Sounds boring. Isn't.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, of course, joins us to discuss the week's news.</p>
