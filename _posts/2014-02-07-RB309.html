<p>We're back after a nice long rest, and boy oh boy did a lot of stuff happen during the break. Adam Boileau joins the show to discuss the choicest selection of news items to emerge over the last six weeks.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's feature slot we chat to <a href="http://twitter.com/thecolonial">OJ Reeves</a> about his work in upgrading Meterpreter, the Metasploit payload. There are some cool new features on the way, he'll clue us in on those.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by <a href="http://tenable.com/">Tenable Network Security</a>. </p>
