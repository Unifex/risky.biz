<p>On this week's podcast we'll hear from Daniel Hodson of Elttam Security here in Australia. Daniel and his business partner Matt Jones have been looking into the security of messaging software that has recommended by the EFF. Does a bunch of ticks from the EFF actually say much about app security? Well, not really, as it turns out.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's sponsor interview we hear from Senetas co-founder and CTO Julian Fay. Senetas, of course, make layer 2 encryption equipment. They'll be releasing a 100Gbps full line rate encryption box soon, they make awesome kit. But this week Julian joins us to weigh in, briefly, on the Apple vs FBI mess, as well as to have a discussion about some interesting use cases he's seen for layer two stuff lately.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, will also pop in to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
<p>Oh, and do add <a href="https://twitter.com/riskybusiness">Patrick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/metlstorm">Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.</p>
