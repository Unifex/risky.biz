<p>The following is a complete recording of an absolutely fascinating presentation by Robert Clark -- the operational attorney for the US Army Cyber Command.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>His presentation examines the legal regime surrounding cyberspace operations. </p>
<p>He looks at the legal underpinnings of computer network security; defense; exploitation; and, attack. It is absolutely riveting stuff and I hope to be catching up with Mr. Clark at some point during the conference to ask him about six million questions.</p>
