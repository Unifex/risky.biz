<p>The following is a recording of David Rice's talk at AusCERT's 2009 conference. David is a sensational public speaker. Risky.Biz actually podcasted his keynote from the GovCERT conference in the Netherlands last year. </p>

<p>This talk is similar, but sufficiently different to warrant posting here. </p>
<p>David is best known as the author of Geekonomics: The Real Cost Of Insecure Software, and a consultant with Monterey Group. Enjoy!</p>
