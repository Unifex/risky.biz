<p>Episode 190 of the Risky Business podcast is brought to you by our good buddies at Astaro. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Astaro's Jack Daniel joins us in this week's sponsor interview to talk about the evolution of firewalls. We try to predict what they're going to look like, five or ten years out. No surprises for guessing convergence is going to be a big thing.</p>
<p>In this week's feature interview we chat with Kowsik Guruswamy of muDynamics about a project his company kicked off called pcapr.net</p>
<p>It's an online archive of packet captures/traces with 60 million packets archived and 5200 members contributing. It's a great project and I'm surprised more people in the infosec community haven't heard of it.</p>
<p>As always, Adam Boileau stops in for a check of the week's news.</p>
