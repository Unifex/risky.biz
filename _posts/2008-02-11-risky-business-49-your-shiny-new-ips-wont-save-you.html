<p>This week's special, longer and stronger podcast is all about intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and is hosted by the fine folk at Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>By now you've been Powerpointed to death by vendor sales reps who insist their latest system can block attacks that haven't been <em>invented</em> yet. Of course that's utter BS, as Declan Ingram points out in his must-hear presentation on IDS and IPS.</p>
<p>Between 24 X 7 monitoring staff -- yours or outsourced -- slacking off and playing Xbox instead of reading real-time logs, to the inherent flaws in self-learning IPS, there's something in this talk for everyone.</p>
<p>On this week's show:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZDNet Australia's Munir Kotadia discusses the week's news with Risky Business host Patrick Gray</li>
<li>Hear <a href="http://www.securusglobal.com/" target="new">Securus Global</a> consultant Declan Ingram's IDS/IPS presentation, edited for your aural pleasure</li>
