<p>On this week's show we're chatting with Kevin Finisterre about Silverpush -- the creepy ultrasonic audio-beaconing technology used by advertising companies that was in the press a couple of weeks ago. Kevin was all over it and he joins me to discuss the growing overlap between the techniques used by marketers and blackhats.</p>

<p>This week's show is brought to you by Bugcrowd, big thanks to them. In this week's sponsor interview Bugcrowd CEO Casey Ellis joins us to discuss more on bug economics -- how do you price bugs? How do you determine bounty pools? It's not as simple as saying, well, XXE's are worth $500 each and XSS $200. The dynamics here are actually a little more complex than that.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins the show to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
