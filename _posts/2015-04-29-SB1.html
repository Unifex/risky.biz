<p>Risky Business host Patrick Gray and Australian comedian Dan Ilic talk about topics that have nothing to do with information security.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Like:</p>
<p>* Australia's obsession with the Gallipoli campaign and the sacking of Scott McIntyre from the SBS.<br/>
* Australia's new vaccination requirements for parents who still want all those tasty, tasty tax benefits.<br/>
* The "ISIS doctor", Tareq Kamleh. Is he doing anything wrong?</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: I didn't bother editing out naughty words in this one, so if you have kids in the car you may not wish to expose them to our awful language.</p>
