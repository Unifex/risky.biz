<p>On this week's show -- in addition to covering the latest claims about the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto -- we're taking a look at a recent deal between a very large bank in Australia and Sydney's University of New South Wales. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>UNSW has had a lot of success over the last few years in actually training people to think offensively. They seem to have cracked a formula where others have tried and failed. Now, they've got $1.6m to play with courtesy of the Commonwealth Bank. This could be a model for colleges and universities everywhere. Whether you're a CSO having trouble recruiting good staff or you work in academia, you really want to hear this week's feature interviews with Brendan Hopper and CBA CSO Ben Heyes.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Bromium. </p>
<p>Bromium makes awesome micro-virtualisation software that really does neutralise the threat of memory corruption exploits in desktop environments. A speed bump for them has been their software requires Intel's virtualisation instruction extensions to work. Well, they've been around long enough now for Bromium to be getting some serious traction at the top end of town. They've also brought out version 3 of their software. with Bromium's Chief Security Architect Rahul Kashyap joins us in this week's sponsor interview to update us on what they've been up to for the last year or so.</p>
<p>The Grugq is in the news chair this week. Adam is busy running Kiwicon in Wellington.</p>
