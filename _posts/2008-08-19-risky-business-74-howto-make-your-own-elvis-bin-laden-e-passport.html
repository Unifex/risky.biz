<p>This week's Risky Business is brought to you by Microsoft and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte virtual hosting. On this week's show we take a look at e-passport security. After 9-11, <a href="http://www.bushorchimp.com/" target="new">Chimp W Shrub</a> decreed that foreigners wanting to enter the United States would soon need to carry new-fangled, biometric passports with embedded wireless RFIDs. </p>

<p>The result was a rush job the likes of which you've never seen.</p>
<p>This week's guest, <strong>Peter Gutmann</strong>, has figured out how to modify the data on e-passport chips. He hasn't broken the encryption scheme responsible for signing the data but that doesn't matter -- no one checks to see if the signing key is genuine and even if they do the implementation is so bad it's easy to fool.</p>
<p>The recent theft in Britain of 3,000 blank e-passports in a van hijacking is starting to make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>ZDNet Australia's <strong>Munir Kotadia</strong> is back this week to chat about recent news, and this week's sponsor interview is with Microsoft's <strong>Jeffery Jones</strong> who talks comparative vulnerability analysis.</p>
