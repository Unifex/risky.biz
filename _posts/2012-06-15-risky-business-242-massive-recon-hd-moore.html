<p>On this week's show we chat with Rapid7's H D Moore about massive recon in both the IPv4 and IPv6 worlds. He's been busy basically banner grabbing the entire Internet and he's found some really, really weird stuff out there. There are some very interesting nuggets in that interview. Check it out.</p>

<p>This week's show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security so in this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with Tenable's CSO Marcus Ranum about why the hell people are still using fast hashing algorithms for password storage. We also talk about a couple of novel approaches to authenticating high-value clients in the finance world.</p>
<p>Normally we'd start off with the week's news segment with Adam Boileau, but he's off in Estonia at the moment, so filling in for him this week is his colleague at Insomnia Security, Mark "Pipes" Piper.</p>
