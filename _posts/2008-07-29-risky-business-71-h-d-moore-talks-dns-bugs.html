<p>This week's Risky Business is sponsored by Microsoft and hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's feature guest on Risky Business is H D Moore. He's the creator of the Metasploit framework and considered by Those Who Know to be a very smart chappy indeed. He joins us this week to talk about the DNS bugs discovered by Dan Kaminsky.</p>
<p>H D, in conjunction with his good buddy |)ruid, has released exploit code for the bugs, but fails to see <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/07/21/2212227&amp;from=rss" target="new">why</a> <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/07/08/195225" target="new">they're</a> considered <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7525206.stm" target="new">such</a> a <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/07/the_web_just_became_a_much_mor.html?nav=rss_blog" target="new">big</a> <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/07/22/kaminsky-on-the-nets.html" target="new">deal</a>.</p>
<p>Considering we've seen <a href="http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_vul38590.htm" target="new">similar</a> <a href="http://www.trusteer.com/bind9dns" target="new">bugs</a> in the past, it's a fair position. Sure, it's a problem, but why the fuss now?</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat to Microsoft's Virus Research and Response Coordinator, Jaukub Kaminsky. (No relation to Dan..) We go over the whitelist/blacklist thing again, as well as having a chat about what it's like being a malware guy at Microsoft. </p>
<p>The company got off to an inauspicious start with AV technologies in the early 90s (MSAV.EXE - remember that? Shudder\u2026), but Jakub says things have changed considerably since then.</p>
<p>Regular guest, ZDNet Australia editor Munir Kotadia, is away on holidays this week. Instead we'll chat to Adam "Metlstorm" Boileau </p>
