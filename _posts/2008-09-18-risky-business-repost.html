<p>For some inexplicable reason, when I posted this week's podcast my content management system (fancy way of saying WordPress) wound up sending out the wrong file with the post in the RSS feed. I'd linked to a presentation by David Rice at GovCERT which WordPress decided should be this week's podcast. Ugh.</p>

<p>So, apologies, listeners... you got David Rice's presentation to GovCERT in Rotterdam instead of my interview with David Rice!</p>
<p>So let's try that again... if you want to actually hear David's presentation you can grab it from link in the older post...</p>
