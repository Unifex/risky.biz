The podcast edged out competition from other IT publishers and the ABC to take the award for Best Technology Audio Program for the third year running.
</p>
<p>
Big thanks go out to all the listeners who make Risky Business a viable media outlet, the guests who take the time to appear on the show and to the sponsors who keep a roof over my head.
</p>
<p>
But of course biggest thanks of all go to Adam Boileau for his consistently insightful and lulzy turns as our regular news guest.
</p>
<p>
And congratulations to <a href="http://www.gusworld.com.au/blog/?p=973" target="new">all the other winners</a>.
