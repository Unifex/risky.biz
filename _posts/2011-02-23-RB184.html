<p>On this week's show we're having a chat with the editor of Wired.com's Threat Level blog, Kevin Poulsen. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>He joins us to discuss his new book, <a href="http://kingpin.cc" target="new">Kingpin</a>, which is out this week in the US and on March 1st is Australia.</p>
<p>Kingpin tells the story of Max Ray Vision, a hacker who started off as a typical carder but came to control virtually the entire online credit card fraud scene in the English speaking world. How? By owning rival forums, merging their users into his site and then torching the competition. It was pretty effective.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau joins us to discuss the week's news.</p>
