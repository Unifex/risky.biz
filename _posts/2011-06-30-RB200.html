<p>Episode 200 FTW!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's feature interview we'll be chatting with Daniel Grzelak. Dan's the founder of  shouldichangemypassword.com -- and interesting little website that pulls together compromised information and lets you see if you've been affected.</p>
<p>Dan was searching Google for .sql files that had inadvertently been made accessible online and indexed... aaaaand he found the entire database for Groupon India including plaintext passwords <a href="http://risky.biz/sosasta" target="new">FOR THE LOSE</a>!!! He'll be telling us all about that after the news.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, of course, joins the show to discuss the week's security news.</p>
<p>NOTE: CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE. NO NAUGHTY WORD EDITS THIS WEEK.</p>
