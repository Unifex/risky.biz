<p>If you're an avid RB2 listener you would have already heard the ShakaCon presentation by Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco on non-conventional keystroke sniffing techniques.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Their <a href="https://risky.biz/netcasts/rb2/rb2-shakacon-presentation-hackers-freakin-laser-beams-their-heads-presentation">presentation</a> was on sniffing keystrokes through powerlines, or alternatively by using freakin' lasers attached to their frickin' heads to detect he sound of keystrokes and then work out what was being typed.</p>
<p>Well, RB2 correspondent Paul Craig was in Hawaii for ShakaCon and scored this interview with the pair, although it should be said that Andrea is the guy who speaks most here.  Enjoy.</p>
