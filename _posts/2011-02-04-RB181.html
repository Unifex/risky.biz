<p>This week's edition of the show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security. We'll hear from Tenable's Paul Asadorian in this week's sponsor interview.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's feature interview we're chatting with Immunity Inc's Bas Alberts about the security of Google's Android mobile operating system. As it turns out, Android's patching model is pretty awful. </p>
<p>To demonstrate the problems with Android, this week's feature guest, Bas Alberts, took a Webkit bug affecting the Chrome browser found on Android devices, attacked his boss's phone and used a garden variety Linux kernel local privilege escalation vulnerability to completely own the phone. He turned it into a video and it was uncomfortable viewing to say the least.</p>
<p>Bas works for Immunity Inc in the USA and joined me by phone to discuss his research and its implications.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau is back on deck to discuss the week's news headlines!</p>
