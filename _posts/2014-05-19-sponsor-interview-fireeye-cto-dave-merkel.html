<p>In this sponsor cast we're chatting with Dave Merkel, the CTO of FireEye. Dave has been around the infosec traps since the 90s -- long enough to see how things have changed. One of the things that has changed is the acknowledgement by the market that you can't really keep attackers from gaining a foothold on at least *a* device within your environment. </p>
