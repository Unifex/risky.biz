<p>On this week's show we're chatting with Zach Lanier of Duo Security about some work he did on bypassing PayPal's two-factor authentication. In short, PayPal's implementation had an absolute clanger of a logic bug in it that these guys were able to find. The secret sauce to the attack? Flight mode! No joke.</p>

<p>This week's show is sponsored by Tenable Network Security, thanks to them! In this week's sponsor interview we'll hear from Tenable's Marcus Ranum about whether or not law enforcement agencies actually have their priorities straight when it comes to computer crime. Are they going after targets that most harm society? Or are they just hitting soft targets? </p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins us to discuss the week's news headlines. Show notes are <a href="http://risky.biz/RB327_notes">here</a>.</p>
