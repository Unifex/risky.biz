In this week's feature interview we chat with Stephen Ridley about all things IoT. Stephen is a researcher turned 
entrepreneur and he'll be along to talk about the platform consolidation we're going to see when it comes to "things". 
Once that settles, he argues, we'll get a better idea of the security risks we should really, actually be worried about.

In this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with Simon Galbally at Senetas.

Senetas, of course, makes high assurance network encryptors and Simon joins us this week to talk about where 
certification schemes might be headed. Did you know there are no sunset clauses on many of the certification schemes out
there? So yeah, you can be using a FIPS certified box that's riddled with known bugs and yep, it's still certified. 
Certifications could start moving towards more continuous models.

Insomnia Security's Mark Piper is this week's news guest. 

Oh, and do add [Patrick](https://twitter.com/riskybusiness) on Twitter if that's your thing.
