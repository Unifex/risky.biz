<p>The following is a recording of David Jorm's AusCERT presentation. You might have heard Dave preview his talk on last week's episode of the regular Risky Business podcast.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Dave, who works as a security response engineer for a vendor, studies geography and mathematics at the University of Queensland and recently completed a study on long-term remote-sensing analysis of North Korea. In his talk he looks at an OSINT analysis of North Korea\u2026 he talks about the work he did as well as looking at what other North Korea watchers are up to. There's some really cool stuff in there about Red Star Linux, too -- it's a North Korean Linux distribution that's surprisingly polished.</p>
<p>So here he is -- it's Dave Jorm's AusCERT talk. Enjoy.</p>
