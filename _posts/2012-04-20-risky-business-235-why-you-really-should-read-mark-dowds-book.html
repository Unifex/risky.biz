<p>We've got a jam-packed show this week! We'll be hearing from Ruxcon organiser Chris Spencer about a new conference he's putting together. It's called BreakPoint and he's trying to establish it as a truly international conference.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We'll also be chatting with Mark Dowd about his, shall we say, more interesting vulnerability disclosure practices.</p>
<p>And in this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with RSA Security's Ian Farqhuar about BYOD -- bring your own devices. He says it's possible to spin the BYOD phenomenon into a security positive, basically because you now have an excuse to treat all your endpoints as hostile. It makes sense.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, joins us for the week's news headlines.</p>
