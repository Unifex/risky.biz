<p>In this week's feature interview we chat with Richard Bejtlich. He serves as the chief security strategist at FireEye. He's a nonresident fellow with the Brookings Institute and he joins me this week to talk about the OPM breach, honeypots, China and Edward Snowden.</p>

<p>This week's show is sponsored by Palo Alto Networks. This week's sponsor interview is with Ryan Olson of Palo's Threat Intelligence Unit 42 -- yes, that is a hitchhikers guide reference. He'll be joining us to discuss an APT campaign they uncovered in Asia -- it's called Lotus Blossom and it's yet another example of likely state sponsored APT activity targeting the region. Depressingly, it uses CVEs that start with 2012. Ugh.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, joins us to discuss the week's security news.</p>
