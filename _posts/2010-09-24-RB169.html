<p>This week's feature is a chat with industry legend Dan Geer about Stuxnet. The more we find out about Stuxnet the more it looks like something ripped out of a spy thriller. It used four 0day bugs, two stolen code signing keys and infected a bunch of systems in Iran. </p>

<p>Speculation that the worm was targeting specific facilities in Iran has grown over the last week and we'll see what Dan thinks about that.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau joins us to discuss the week's news and Tenable Network Security chief executive Ron Gula pops in for this week's sponsor interview.</p>
