<p>The following is a recording of HD Moore's AusCERT plenary, all about the research he's done scanning the entire Internet. HD is one of the smartest guys in the business, and it's a great talk. But you might actually need to slow it down a bit, because I don't think I've ever encountered anyone in my life who can speak as fast as HD does. He sometimes speaks at a pace that is faster than my ability to comprehend what he's saying. But as I say, it's a great talk -- it's called Global Vulnerability Analysis.</p>
