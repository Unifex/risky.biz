<p>This week's feature interview is with Casey Ellis of <a href="http://bugcrowd.com/" target="new">BugCrowd.com</a> -- a new business that runs outsourced bug bounty programs. It's a great idea and it's one that I personally think will really take off over the next couple of years.</p>

<p>This week's show is brought to you by our good friends at Adobe. </p>
<p>Adobe's director of product security and privacy Brad Arkin will be along a bit later on with an update on the phantom 0day issue the company experienced last year, as well as filling us in on some efforts designed to combat spearphishing attacks that use dodgy Flash objects embedded in Office files. It's more interesting than it sounds!</p>
<p>Adam Boileau is back in the news seat for a chat about recent headlines. You can find links to all the articles we discussed <a href="http://risky.biz/RB268_notes" target="new">here</a>.</p>
