<p>On this week's show we're taking a look at new laws in the United Kingdom that are designed to automate the collection of certain types of intelligence from telcos and ISPs. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The information itself has previously been accessible without warrant by UK intelligence agencies, but now they'll <a>be able to bring up the data with a few keystrokes in real time</a>. </p>
<p>That simple change could result in grave invasions of privacy, according to this week's guest, Roelof Temmingh of <a a="" href="http://paterva.com/" paterva="">, the makers of Maltego. </a></p>
<p>Also this week Chris Gatford of <a href="http://hacklabs.com/" target="new">HackLabs</a> drops by for this week's sponsor interview. In it we discuss some statistics he's cobbled together from HackLabs last 100 or so penetration tests. They're not so much surprising as, you know, depressing.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, is along to discuss this week's news. And <a href="http://risky.biz/CabinCr3w" target="new">this, spectacular fail</a>.</p>
