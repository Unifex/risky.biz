<p>Fraud analytics, security event management and the latest news. Your weekly Australian security podcast is available for download, thanks to our sponsor Cybertrust and hosting partner Vigabyte.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Munir Kotadia joins us from ZDNet Australia to discuss the week's news</li>
<li>Fair Isaac CEO Dr. Mark Greene (not the guy from ER) discusses fraud analytics software used by banks</li>
<li>Cybertrust's Paul Nevin talks SEM</li>
</ul>
<p>*** Prior to posting this entry, I moderated ITRadio's blog comments, which this week consisted entirely of spam. Ladies and gentleman, <em>Risky Business</em> attracts some weird comment spam, but today's promise of "gay midget videos" really takes the cake. And you thought e-mail spam was bad. I'll keep you all updated on anything else weird I come across.</p>
