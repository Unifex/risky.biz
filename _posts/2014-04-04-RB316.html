<p>On this week's show we're taking a look at the Target/Trustwave suit. A couple of banks were suing Target and its alleged security auditor Trustwave over the massive credit card data breach last year. That suit has been withdrawn, possibly temporarily, and another has been filed on behalf of some other banks. We speak with former New York assistant DA and infosec law specialist Dave Stampley about these types of suits. Do they have legs?</p>

<p>This week we welcome a new sponsor -- Rapid7. </p>
<p>Rapid7 is launching an interesting campaign right now to try to fix the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in America. They say it's stifling research. Rapid7's global security strategist Trey Ford joins the show to fill us in on that. </p>
<p>As news regulars Adam Boileau and The Grugq are both in Singapore for Syscan and probably nursing cripping hangovers, this week we're joined by a special guest in the news chair, Christopher Hoff. Hoff is the Vice President of Strategy for Juniper Networks' security business unit, but you may know him as Beaker on Twitter.</p>
