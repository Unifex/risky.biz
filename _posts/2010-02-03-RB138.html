<p>Risky Business is back for 2010!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's program we chat with information security legend Dan Geer.\t</p>
<p>Dan's the Chief Information Security Officer for In-Q-Tel, which is, in essence, the technology investment arm of the CIA. He's not appearing in Risky Business is his capacity as an In-Q-Tel employee, however, he joins us as a veteran of the information security industry.</p>
<p>Dan helped create Kerberos during his tie with project Athena at MIT and was the chief technology officer at @Stake for a time. </p>
<p>He's joining us to discuss his prediction of a decline in the popularity of general-purpose computers and the rise of tightly controlled devices like Apple's iPad. </p>
<p>Later on we'll be joined by another veteran, Ron Gula, the chief executive of Tenable Network Security, our sponsor. Ron's popping in to have a bit of a chat about the great big hairy attack on Google.</p>
<p>First, as always, we'll cover the news headlines with our regular guest Adam Boileau.</p>
