<p>On the final day of AusCERT last week delegates were treated to a fascinating talk by Dr. Jason Fox, gamification expert and author of the book The Game Changer.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Jason's expertise is in finding out how to take the motivational aspects of games and apply them to work processes. We all know that sitting your staff down in a dimly lit auditorium to lecture them on spear phishing does precisely nothing to change user behaviour. But what if you made the hunt for spear phishing messages a game?</p>
<p>I sat down with Jason Fox after his presentation and recorded this interview.</p>
