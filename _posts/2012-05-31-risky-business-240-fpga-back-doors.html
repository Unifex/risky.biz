<p>On this week's show we're taking a look at some research out of Cambridge University that's drawn a lot of attention. It involves a claim that researchers found a hardware back door on a Chinese-made FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>That FPGA is apparently used in military hardware. You can find links to the draft paper and a write-up <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sps32/sec_news.html#Assurance" target="new">here</a>.</p>
<p>So was this "back door" put there by super-secret Chinese cyber-warriors? Or is it something much less interesting like an undocumented debugging interface?</p>
<p>Peter Gutmann is this week's feature guest and he'll be telling us all about it.</p>
<p>This week's show is sponsored by SensePost. </p>
<p><a href="http://sensepost.com/" target="new">SensePost</a> is a South African security consultancy that also has a presence in Europe. They are some seriously, seriously smart people and we're thrilled to have them as a sponsor.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we're taking a look at some research the company has done into cloning RSA soft tokens. We all know that soft tokens are theoretically weak, but SensePost's Behrang Fouladi <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/05/rsa-securid-software-token-cloning-attack/" target="new">set his mind to actually reversing them</a> and seeing just how easy it is. As it turns out, very.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, stops by to discuss the week's news.</p>
