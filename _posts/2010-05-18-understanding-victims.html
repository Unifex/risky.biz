<p>In this podcast you'll hear a presentation by Frank Stajano of the University of Cambridge. In it he discusses seven principles for systems security derived from understanding scam victims.  </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>He argues that by understanding the recurring behavioural patterns of victims that hustlers have learned to exploit, we can create systems that are more resistant to fraud. </p>
<p>Frank plays three videos in the talk. With two of them you can get by with the audio alone, but the first one has a significant visual component. The good news is I found the video on Youtube, and I've linked to it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyCicKYAmL0" target="new">here</a>. </p>
<p>You'll hear me, during this presentation, say something along the lines of "check out the video now" so you can pause the mp3 and watch the video. Sounds a bit involved, I know, but it's the only way I could think of to bring this presentation to you.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyCicKYAmL0" target="new">YouTube link again</a>.</p>
