<p>This week we're checking in with Josh Drake of Zimperium. With exploitation of Stagefright via Josh's sweet, sweet exploit you'd think the mother of all worms is coming. Well, probably not. Later versions of Android are tricky to exploit, and the diversity of hardware in earlier versions means coming up with one exploit to rule them all isn't really feasible. We'll drill down into that with Josh in a little while.</p>

<p>This week's show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security. Tenable's very own Jack Daniel will be along in this week's sponsor interview to add a bit of context to recent car hacking news. Jack was a mechanic in a previous life. I myself worked for Bosch as an engineer designing automotive electronics in the 90s. So we put our old man pants on and talk about how we arrived in a world where 1.4 million Chrysler owners are patching their vehicles against security flaws using a mailed out USB stick.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, joins the show to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
