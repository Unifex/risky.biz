<p>On this week's show we're talking Web Application firewalls with <a href="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/" target="new">Jeremiah Grossman</a>. He's the founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.whitehatsec.com/" target="new">WhiteHat Security</a> -- and he's also a semi regular guest on Risky Business.</p>

<p>On this week's podcast Jeremiah chats about WAFs, or Web Application firewalls, which he says come in quite handy. Admittedly he's biased, having done some work on WAFs that work with F5 kit, but he provides some pretty compelling arguments as to why these things are assets.</p>
<p>It takes typical organisations around 130 days to fix sequel injection bugs in code. But you can mitigate these sorts of things with a Web app firewall, and you won't even have to deal with the development team! Hooray!</p>
<p>Check Point Software's Steve MacDonald also drops by for this week's sponsor interview, which is about considering allowing staff to bring their own laptops to work. </p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/" target="new">ZDNet Australia's</a></i> Munir Kotadia is sick this week, so <a href="http://www.kiwicon.org" target="new">Kiwicon</a> organiser and <a href=" http://storm.net.nz/projects/16" target="new">Winlockpwn</a> creator Adam Boileau steps in to fill his shoes.</p>
