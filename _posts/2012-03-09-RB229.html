<p>On this week's show we're catching up with Mr. Popular himself, Adrian Lamo.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Adrian is best known as the guy who turned in alleged Wikileaks source Bradley Manning, but he also has some very interesting perspectives on the LulzSec arrests.</p>
<p>This week's show is sponsored by Tenable Network Security! In this week's sponsor interview Tenable product Manager Jack Daniel will be along to chat about a recent <a href="http://www.tenable.com/expert-resources/webinars/2012-the-politics-of-security-getting-what-you-want-and-avoiding-what-you-" target="new">Tenable Webinar</a> that was all about the internal politics of security. If you're struggling to get your colleagues on side, you want to listen to that interview!</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins the show to discuss the week's news.</p>
