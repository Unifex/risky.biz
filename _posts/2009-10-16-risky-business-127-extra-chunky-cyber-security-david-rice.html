<p>This week's show features an excerpt from David Rice's plenary speech at the GovCERT Symposium in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In his talk, David asks what the security business could learn from pasta sauce, Diet Pepsi and food science in general. It's a bit out there, but it's well worth a listen.</p>
<p>You'll also hear from Microsoft Australia's Andrew Parsons about a couple of <a href="https://www.dreamspark.com/default.aspx" target="new">programs</a> Microsoft is running that involve giving away an absolute tonne of expensive software to students and start-ups. It's not a security related interview, but hey, the programs are pretty interesting and worth featuring.</p>
<p>There's no news guest this week -- I'm still travelling back to Australia from Europe. It's a long way. No, really... It's far. </p>
<p>But we'll be back to regular programming next week.</p>
