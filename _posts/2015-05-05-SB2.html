<p>In this edition of Serious Business, Australia's Most Hated Man (tm) Dan Ilic and I speak about the (failed) shooting attack against a group of very silly Americans who got together to denigrate Islam.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We also speak about Apple's stupid watch. I should warn you, too, I don't edit this podcast for bad language and there are f-bombs aplenty. So if you have your kids in your car and you don't want them hearing my awful, awful language, please turn off this podcast now.</p>
