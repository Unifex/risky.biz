<p>On this week's show we'll wrap Ruxcon, Sydney's technical security conference. It was held over the weekend, and there were some cracking presentations. Security researcher Mark Dowd joins us with his impressions of the conference presentations.</p>
<p>We'll also check in with Munir Kotadia with a look at the last week's news headlines, and in this week's sponsor interview Microsoft's Julita Atalla joins us to discuss the company's plans to release free antivirus software.</p>
