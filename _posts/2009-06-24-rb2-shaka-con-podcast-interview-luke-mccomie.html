<p>In this interview Risky.Biz reporter Paul Craig talks to BT security consultant Luke McComie about corporate espionage. Luke presented a keynote on the topic at the Shaka Con conference in Hawaii. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Throughout that presentation we heard how corporations don't adequately secure their physical environments, and this can lead to some pretty nasty consequences as far as information leakage goes. We heard Luke tell some war stories about slipping past security guards in that one.</p>
<p>So we heard about the victories, but in this interview Paul asks Luke to explain some of his more epic failures while doing the same.</p>
