<p>Microsoft was kind enough to sponsor our coverage of AusCERT's 2011 conference and as a part of that sponsorship arrangement we're doing these sponsored podcasts. We've already posted two interviews with Microsoft peeps about security issues, but we're posting this full talk as well.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Maarten Van Horenbeeck works in the Microsoft Security Response Center managing Microsoft's efforts to share information on security vulnerabilities with third party security software providers, government agencies and national CERT teams. </p>
<p>This talk is about how Microsoft applies ratings to its product vulnerabilities... there are a bunch of ratings systems out there... Maarten covers off some of these and discuss how MS boils down its own scores. I hope you enjoy this talk.</p>
