<p>It's episode 187, the homicide edition, and RSA conveniently falls victim to a drive by. Thanks guys!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's show is a ripper. We've got two feature guests -- Kimberly Zenz of iDefense and Paul Ducklin of Sophos.</p>
<p>We talk about everything from recent disinformation and social media manipulation campaigns in the Middle East and Belarus, the breach of RSA by parties unknown wielding those mysterious "APTs". Allegedly.</p>
<p>Duck and I also have a chat about Privacy International proclamation that Skype is a threat to the security and privacy of activists and dissidents. We don't know what they've been smoking over there at Privacy International, but I bet you it's some good stuff -- the criticisms levelled against Skype are, largely, baseless. Allegedly.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau joins us, as always, to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
