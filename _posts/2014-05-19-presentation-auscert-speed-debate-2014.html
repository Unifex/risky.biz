<p>We're going to close out this year's coverage the way we normally do it: with a recording of the AusCERT speed debate! </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>I was a debater this year and as you'll hear I had zero time to prepare, so my contributions are pretty lame, but there was a hell of a panel like always. The whole thing was moderated by Adam Spencer. </p>
<p>Most of it makes no sense, some of it is funny, some of it is just stupid. Like it or loathe it, it's almost become an institution at this point so we absolutely have to include it.</p>
<p>So here it is! The speed debate! The closing event from AusCERT 2014, I hope you enjoy it.</p>
