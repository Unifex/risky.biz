<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by the fine folks at Sophos, the makers of all types of security software and the employer many, many smart cookies.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's show is a bit of a mixed bag. We'll of course be checking in with our buddy Adam Boileau to discuss the week's news headlines, then we'll be having a chat with journalist Cameron Stewart. He works for The Australian, a Murdoch-owned newspaper, and he's written <a href="http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26036951-15306,00.html" target="new">a series of articles</a> alleging Australia's spy agency ASIO has been called in to investigate Chinese networking equipment manufacturer Huawei over alleged links to Chinese intelligence organisations. </p>
<p>Interesting stuff to say the least.</p>
<p>Then we're going all Mac on you. We'll be chatting to Brett Olsen, who's been doing some interesting work in looking at the privacy implications of some iPhone applications. Yes, I know iPhone stuff has been done to death, but Olsen's <a href="http://i-phone-home.blogspot.com/" target="new">i-phone-home project</a> could be a preview of things to come across the whole mobile computing space.</p>
<p>Then of course we'll be chatting with Sean Richmond of <a href="http://sophos.com.au/" target="new">Sophos</a> in this week's sponsor interview. He'll be giving us a vendor take on Apple's decision to build some rudimentary AV into its operating system.</p>
