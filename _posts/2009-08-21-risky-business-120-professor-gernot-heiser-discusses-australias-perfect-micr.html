<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by Sophos and hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we chat with Professor Gernot Heiser. He's the chief Technology Officer of OK-Labs, or Open Kernel Labs. The company makes software for embedded systems, and recently NICTA -- that's a government funded technology R&amp;D lab -- has claimed to have mathematically verified one of the OK-labs kernels as being mathematically perfect. No buffer overflows. No null pointer dereferences. No divide by zeros. </p>
<p>The Prof stops by to explain what this all means. </p>
<p>We also chat with Sean Richmond from Sophos in this week's sponsor interview. We quiz Sean on this virus doing the rounds that affects Delphi development environments. Interesting stuff!</p>
<p>And of course Adam Boileau pops by with the week's news headlines.</p>
