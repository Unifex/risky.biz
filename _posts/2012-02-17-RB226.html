<p>On this week's show we chat with information security legend Dan Geer about traffic analysis and "digital exhaust". </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Everything we do online produces a tonne of metadata. What can be inferred through the analysis of this metadata and who's likely to analyse it?</p>
<p>Part one of my chat with Dan Geer is this week's feature interview.</p>
<p>This week's show is sponsored by RSA Security, the security division of EMC.</p>
<p>So in this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with RSA's Mason Hooper about the company's 2012 Cybercrime Trends Report. Is Zeus still Zeusy? Still Godlike? We'll find out at the back of this week's show.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, of course, drops in to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
