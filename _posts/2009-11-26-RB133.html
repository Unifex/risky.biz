<p>This week's show is brought to you by Microsoft.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We've got a couple of great stories in this week's show. We'll be chatting with our semi regular guest Adam Pointon, who's taken a bit of a look through the leaked 911 pager messages that popped up on Wikileaks overnight.</p>
<p>While everyone's been trawling through them looking for evidence that the aliens did it, Adam's been taking a look at the automatically generated messages that network equipment was sending out. It's interesting stuff.</p>
<p>We'll also check in with Mikhail Davidov from Leviathan Security in the USA. They've made the SSL/TLS flaw you've been hearing about MUCH more practical and they've written code that will let you -- yes, you -- perform a channel downgrade attack. </p>
<p>Adam Boileau is this week's news guest, and we're joined by Microsoft's Stuart Strathdee in this week's sponsor interview.</p>
