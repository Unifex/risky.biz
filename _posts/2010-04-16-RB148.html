<p>On this week's show we have a chat to Paul Ducklin about what he sees as questionable ethics behind some mobile malware research.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Researchers from <a href="http://news.rutgers.edu/medrel/news-releases/2010/02/rutgers-researchers-20100222/" target="new">Rutgers University</a> and <a href="http://www.veracode.com/blog/2010/02/is-your-blackberry-app-spying-on-you/" target="new">Veracode</a> have written mobile phone malware or trojans; the latter even released the source code to their BlackBerry trojan. But what purpose does this serve, asks Duck. Is there any benefit at all to be had from writing and releasing trojans, even if they are written for academic purposes?</p>
<p>This week's sponsor interview is with Check Point's Fredrik Borjesson, and Adam Boileau is the week's feature guest.</p>
