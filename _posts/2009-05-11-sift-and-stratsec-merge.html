<p>The new company employs a total of 65 people, with no staff being made redundant from either SIFT or Stratsec during the merger. The new company will retain the stratsec name and recruit 4-5 new staff immediately with a view to further expansion later this year, according to the new company's CTO and SIFT founder Nick Ellsmore.</p>

<p>"We (SIFT) had 15 before the merger, and certainly none being made redundant," he told Risky.biz. "We're looking to recruit 4-5 straight away, and will probably need close to 10 more by the end of the year."</p>
<p>The Australian information security industry has been too fragmented for too long, Ellsmore says, with no real market leader in the "independent" security consulting space.  </p>
<p>"We now have the scale, the breadth, and the depth, to take on virtually any information security project that can be thrown at us," Ellsmore claims. "[SIFT and stratsec] both had a vision for building the dominant firm in this space, and given a good cultural fit between the firms, and a good relationship between the three Directors... we saw an opportunity to fast-track that growth and took it."</p>
