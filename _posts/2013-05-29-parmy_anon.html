<p>You're about to hear Parmy Olson's presentation from AusCERT's 2013 conference. Parmy is a journalist for Forbes, but she's also an author -- she wrote We Are Anonymous, Inside the Hacker world of LulzSec, Anonymous and the Global Cyber Insurgency. She got amazing access to the LulzSec crew and the book is well worth reading.</p>

<p>In this presentation she looks at why these young men got involved in such risky activity. What drove them, and what does the future of Anonymous look like?</p>
