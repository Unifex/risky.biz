<p>This week's feature audio is an excerpt from an AusCERT presentation I recorded last week. The talk, by Brad Barker of the HALO Corporation, discusses the Zeta drug cartel's use of technology and social media. HALO Corporation does everything from intelligence support to kidnap and ransom consulting. Barker has an interesting analysis of how civilian technology is altering methods of operation and the wider battlefield. It's good stuff.</p>

<p>Adobe's director of product security Brad Arkin will be along for this week's sponsor interview to talk about Apple's decision to block vulnerable versions of Flash Player in OS X. Brad also discusses Adobe's controversial -- and subsequently reversed decision -- to NOT patch its CS5 suite of products against a code execution bug.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, drops by to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
