<p>The following is a recording of the traditional closing event of the AusCERT event -- the speed debate. It's hosted by Australian television and radio presenter Adam Spencer, and it's a bit of light fun to end the whole thing on... debaters include Eugene Kaspersky, Bill Caelli, Charlie Miller, Scott McIntyre and more. I'll drop you in here as Adam sets the whole thing up. Enjoy.</p>
