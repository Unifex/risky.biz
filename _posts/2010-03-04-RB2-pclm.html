<p>This is a sponsored podcast. Symantec sponsors the RB2 podcast so once a month we get one of their staff on the line to talk about industry trends, malware... whatever, really!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>And today we're speaking with Vincent Weafer, Symantec's director of security response. Regular listeners of Risky.Biz podcasts would have heard me tonking on a LOT about patch management lately, and in particular the moves by large security vendors like McAfee, Trend and Symantec into that space. </p>
<p>McAfee and Trend have licensed technology from BigFix and Symantec is integrating technology from its Altiris acquisition into its endpoint security products.</p>
<p>It's an interesting trend, and one that I personally think will have some meaningful implications for enterprise security. For one, patch management will all of a sudden be a capability of security teams, not just desktop teams.</p>
<p>So I thought I'd talk about this with Vincent, who sheds light on the trend from a vendor perspective. As you'll hear, I also talked malware with Vincent -- everything from the Zues botnet to the media's favourite Aurora. Enjoy!</p>
