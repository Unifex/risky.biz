<p><img align="left" src="http://www.itradio.com.au/pics/cybertrust_logo.gif"/>Risky Business number 4 is available for download, thanks to Cybertrust and our hosting partner Vigabyte. This week's show is a little different -- we're at the Kickstart IT media conference on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. On today's program we've got representatives from CheckPoint, Trend Micro, AusCERT and Cybertrust. We're also joined by Ian Yates, a freelance journalist to discuss the last week's news.</p>

<p>Next week's show will be produced in Hannover, Germany, at the CeBIT computer expo -- the largest IT expo in the world. I'll be walking the trade floor to find the best new technologies in security.</p>
