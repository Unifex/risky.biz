<p>This week's show is a bit shorter than usual. We'll check in with Adam Boileau to discuss the week's news headlines and catch up with Tenable Network Security CEO Ron Gula in this week's sponsor interview.</p>

<p>Between those two we cover the Playstation Network hack, the kidnapping of Ivan Kaspersky, Microsoft's decision to coordinate the disclosure of vulnerabilities in non-MS products and much, much more!</p>
