<p>On this week's show we chat with Jessie Frazelle. Jessie is a former Docker maintainer who now works at Google on all things "containery". So we talk to her about what's up with containers, basically, and where the security pitfalls are. Like it or not, containers are likely going to be used in your environment, so getting to know them is a must. That's this week's feature.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's show is brought to you by HP Enterprise Security's Fortify! These guys and gals are a new sponsor, and I'm sure most of you know them. They make both static analysis and dynamic analysis code security tools, and this week we're joined by HPE Fortify's James "Jimmy" Rabon to talk about how this whole newfangled devops/agile thing has changed things for them. </p>
<p>The Grugq also joins the show to talk about the week's security news. He's filling in for Adam Boileau who's frantically getting Kiwicon 10 organised.</p>
<p>Oh, and do add <a href="https://twitter.com/riskybusiness">Patrick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq">The Grugq</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.</p>
