<p>On this week's show we take a look at reports that Google is set to banish Microsoft Windows from its operating system over security concerns.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The tech giant says running Windows is just too risky. Google was, after all, famously owned in the Aurora incident through holes in Internet Explorer 6.</p>
<p>But our guest this week, Neohapsis CTO Greg Shipley, says getting owned by a hole in a nine year old browser is probably a sign that your desktop management is the problem, not the platform you've chosen.</p>
<p>Also this week, Marcus Ranum joins us to talk about what he describes ad the non-existent meme that is "Cyberwar". That's this week's sponsor interview.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, checks in to discuss the week's news.</p>
