<p>This week's feature interview is with Mark Dowd of Azimuth Security. Mark joins the show to fill us in on the latest trends in vulnerability research and exploit development. We recap CanSecWest's Pwn2Own competition and look at what 2013 has in store research-wise.</p>

<p>Risky.Biz is pleased to welcome a new sponsor to the lineup -- Solera Networks, makers of fine, big data security software.</p>
<p>These guys make packet capture-based security kit that I'm told is pretty impressive. And we've got an interesting chat in this week's sponsor interview with Solera's chief technology officer Joe Levy. We chat to him about some of the basics of big data security, as well as looking at how point solution providers are increasingly integrating their kit with established SIEM gear and log management consoles. </p>
<p>Insomnia Security's Adam Boileau joins us for a discussion of the week's news.</p>
