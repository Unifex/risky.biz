<p>Domain name regulator auDA moved to terminate Bottle Domains' registrar agreement when it was revealed the company's customer database had been hacked and offered for sale in a black market forum. "Under the terms of the registrar agreement with us they are obliged to inform us of any security breach," auDA CEO Chris Disspain told <a href="http://risky.biz/RB125/" target="new">Risky.Biz in a podcast interview</a>. (Click to hear the full interview.) "That did not happen."</p>

<p>The loss of accreditation would have seen the company stripped of the right to conduct business as a domain name registrar. The domain names of its existing clients would be transferred to auDA itself, which would have acted as an interim registrar.</p>
<p>"[The judge] has stayed <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/domain-news/news-719/" target="new">those orders</a> for a period of time to allow Bottle to go to the court of appeal and apply... for an injunction pending the hearing of a full appeal," Disspain said.</p>
