<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>As soon as you listen to Mark for more than five minutes you'll quickly realise he really knows what he's talking about.</p>
<p>This talk is about performing incident response and forensic analysis on live SCADA networks. It's very interesting stuff and Mark is a great presenter.</p>
