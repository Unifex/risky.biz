<p>In this edition of the show we're taking a look at Microsoft's Office 2010.</p>
<p>Last week I headed to Microsoft's Tech Ed conference on the Gold Coast and caught up with Reed Shaffner, a product manager with the Office team, to chat about the security features in Office 2010. </p>
<p>The company has put a lot of work into making sure the types of attacks that have plagued its office suite over the last few years will be a thing of the past. Will these new measures succeed? </p>
