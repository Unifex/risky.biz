<p>The vulnerability affects versions of PowerPoint running on Windows and Apple OS X, security-vendor McAfee has reported.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The stark warning came this morning as Microsoft posted a security advisory and new entry on its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/SearchResults.aspx?query=Exploit%3AWin32%2FApptom.gen" target="new">Malware Protection Centre website</a>.</p>
<p>"Microsoft is investigating new reports of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office PowerPoint that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file," the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/969136.mspx" target="new">advisory reads</a>. "At this time, we are aware only of limited and targeted attacks that attempt to use this vulnerability."</p>
<p>That's reassuring. Unless you're the one being targeted.</p>
<p>As a fantastically practical mitigation strategy, Microsoft recommends users don't open PowerPoint files that arrive unexpectedly, either from trusted contacts or stranger dangers.</p>
<p>Users who really must open unexpected PowerPoint deliveries can use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment, or MCOIE. That software performs sanity-checks on Microsoft binary formats, converting them to known-safe files. "[The] MOICE will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files," the company says.</p>
<p>Vendors are <a href="http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_vul42288.htm" target="new">rolling out sigs as we speak</a>. </p>
