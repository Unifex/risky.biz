<p>This week's show is brought to you by NetWitness.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The minting of some dodgy SSL certificates has the whole security world in a bit of a tizz, but this week's feature guest thinks much of the resulting media coverage is missing the point. Why are browsers designed to make Boolean trust decisions? Why do they completely trust CA issued certs?</p>
<p>Peter Gutmann of the University of Auckland joins me to discuss.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau pops in for the week's news, as always.</p>
