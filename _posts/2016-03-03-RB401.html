<p>On this week's show we get into a serious technical discussion about deserialisation attacks with with one of Adam Boileau's colleagues, Brendan Jamieson about the biggest issue in infosec that no one is talking about -- deserialisation vulnerabilities and their exploitation.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This attack class is a serious problem in enterprise environments thanks to the release of the YSoSerial tool about a year ago. Pen-testers who are across this bug class are finding issues everywhere they look, and hardly anyone is talking about it. But we do, this week.</p>
<p>Also this week we'll chat with Chris Gatford, the big Kahuna over at this week's sponsor HackLabs. I was talking to Chris recently and he mentioned that cryptolocker ransomware really isn't just affecting consumers anymore. </p>
<p>There was the recent news about a hospital in California that got hosed by ransomware, but I always thought that was the exception to the rule and that consumers were the most likely group to be affected by this stuff. Nope, wrong. Ransomware is getting inside corporate networks and causing all sorts of drama, Chris joins us soon to talk about that. Big thanks to HackLabs for its sponsorship of this week's show!</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, will also pop in to discuss the week's news headlines.</p>
<p>Oh, and do add <a href="https://twitter.com/riskybusiness">Patrick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/metlstorm">Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.</p>
