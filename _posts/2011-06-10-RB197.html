<p>In this week's feature interview we're chatting with Neal Wise of Assurance.com.au about RSA's decision to finally admit what we all knew already -- that its SecurID product line has been compromised. RSA is offering to replace tokens... we'll chat with Neal about whether it will make sense to do that or not.</p>

<p>In this week's sponsor interview we're joined by Astaro's director of Support Alan Toews. We're talking about the silver lining to all the chaos out there at the moment -- does the awareness raised by the actions of groups like LulzSec offset the harm they cause to their victims?</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, pops in to discuss the week's news.</p>
