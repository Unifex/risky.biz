<p>You may or may not have heard of the Shadowserver foundation. It's a volunteer run organisation designed to track malware, botnet activity and electronic fraud. Richard Perlotto runs the technology and operational side of the organisation, but his day job is as a security advisor to Cisco Systems.</p>

<p>Before that, he ran Security Operations for Cisco worldwide for almost four years. In this AusCERT presentation, Perlotto talks about what the Shadowserver foundation actually does -- how it collects its data and what it actually does with that information once it has it. </p>
