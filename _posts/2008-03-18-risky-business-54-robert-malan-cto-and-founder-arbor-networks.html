<p>This week's podcast features an Australian exclusive -- an interview with Robert Malan. He's the founder and CTO of Arbor Networks, a company that does all sorts of cunning things "in the cloud" to mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks. Take that, Ruskies!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Arbor recently acquired Ellacoya networks. They want to start operating closer to the edge of carrier networks, clamping down further on other bot nets badness through policy enforcement.</p>
<p>This week's podcast is brought to you by McAfee and is hosted, as always, by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<p>On this week's show:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZDNet Australia's Munir Kotadia discusses the week's news with Patrick Gray</li>
<li>Patrick Gray mispronounces Robert Malan's last name several times, then interviews him.</li>
<li>Mike Sentonas from McAfee pops in for this week's sponsor interview</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE (20/3): After wondering why this week's download numbers were a bit slow, I realised the post didn't actually go into the RSS feed. Argh. Reposted now, two days later. Sorry!</p>
