<p>In this sponsored podcast we chat with both Arbor Networks' Nick Race and Matt Hollis of Vocus.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We discuss the state of both application and volumetric based DDoS techniques.</p>
<p>As you'd no doubt be aware, Arbor makes DDoS mitigation equipment -- there's the enterprise stuff that blocks application-based attacks, like attacks that exhaust resources on the target, then there's the telco stuff that blocks the volumetric attacks -- a.k.a. bandwidth exhaustion attacks.</p>
<p>I started off by speaking with Matt Hollis of ASX - listed connectivity provider Vocus. These guys have some serious tubes, so they're used to seeing a lot of volumetric attacks. Then I got on the line with Arbor Networks' Nick Race to discuss app-based attacks.</p>
