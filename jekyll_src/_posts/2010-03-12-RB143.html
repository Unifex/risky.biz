<p>On this week's show we're having an extended chat with our good mate Greg Shipley. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Greg's best known as the CTO of Chicago-based information security consultancy Neohapsis, and he'll be joining us to talk about what was on the agenda at the RSA conference. Apparently it's cloud, cloud, cloud... but what does that actually mean, mean, mean? Greg will be along soon to discuss, he's always good.</p>
<p>There will be no sponsor interview this week -- the team at Check Point are snowed under at the moment so we just didn't get an interview organised, but that's cool, because it leaves more time for me and Greg to talk about stuff.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau joins us for the news this week.</p>
