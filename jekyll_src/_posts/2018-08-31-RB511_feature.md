The widespread adoption of smart and IoT devices – everything from drones and security cameras to thermostats and routers, mean the developers of non-Windows-based malware have been pretty busy lately

In fact, there’s been an almost tenfold increase in the volume of these (ELF) samples submitted to Virus Total over the past two years. That's according to a cohort of researchers from the Software and System Security group at French graduate school EURECOM, who set out in 2016 to develop an empirical study of non-Windows malware.

They downloaded hundreds of daily candidate samples from Virus Total for a year, resulting in a dataset of more than 10,000 binaries and a tool called Padawan, an automated framework for dynamic analysis of non-Windows malware.

The researchers presented findings earlier this year at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, and more recently at reverse engineering conference RECon in Montreal. Risky Business contributor Hilary Louise recently caught up over the phone with France-based EURECOM doctoral student Emanuele Cozzi who says the land of Linux-type malware analysis is a bit of a nascent field.
