On this week's show we check in with Matt Tait, who's probably better known by his Twitter handle: pwnallthethings. And we'll be talking about the politicisation of infosec and the science of attribution.

This week's show is brought to you by Bugcrowd. Bugcrowd's CEO and co-founder Casey Ellis will be along in this week's sponsor interview to talk about his adventures running a MongoDB honeypot. Bugcrowd are pretty interested in talking about all those poor MongoDBs getting hosed because, well, if you've got a bug bounty program running, open DBs are the sorts of things that tend to get reported.

As you'll hear in that interview, the attackers who made some fast cash taking control of MongoDBs are now going after other stuff -- elasticsearch, Hadoop.

Adam Boileau, as always, joins the show to discuss the week's security news, and our good buddy Jake Davis is back for another edition of Story Corner.

Links to everything are in this week's <a href='http://risky.biz/RB440_notes'>show notes</a>.

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a>, <a href='https://twitter.com/doublejake'>Jake</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
