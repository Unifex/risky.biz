<p>Melbourne's Age newspaper is carrying a delicious little item today.</p>
<p>The long arm of the law has caught up with the alleged ringleader of the CabinCr3w hacking group. Over the last few months CabinCr3w have pwned a bunch of law enforcement websites, even doxing a bunch of officers.</p>
<p>Pretty ballsy stuff, right? You'd think if you're starting a war with law enforcement you'd have your opsec shit in order, yeah?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/hacking-cases-body-of-evidence-20120411-1wsbh.html" target="new">apparently not</a>!</p>
<p>Criminal mastermind Higinio O. Ochoa III -- his real name, apparently -- has been tracked down via a photo of his girlfriend's boobies. He allegedly posted it on a website along with information stolen from various police services.</p>
<p>The woman, from Wantirna South in the Australian city of Melbourne, was pictured holding a sign that reads ''PwNd by w0rmer &amp; CabinCr3w &lt;3 u BiTch's''.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Mr. Ochoa The Third, he didn't scrub the EXIF data from the photo. The GPS coordinates within lead police right to his girlfriend's house. Oops.</p>
<p>You can't make this shit up.</p>
