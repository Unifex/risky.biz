<p>Risky.Biz has confirmed IBM staff distributed malware-infected USB drives at the AusCERT security conference this week.</p>
<p>In a highly embarrassing admission, the company has sent a broadcast e-mail to all AusCERT attendees warning them of the security lapse. </p>
<p>"At the AusCERT conference this week, you may have collected a complimentary USB key from the IBM booth," the message reads. "Unfortunately we have discovered that some of these USB keys contained malware and we suspect that all USB keys may be affected."</p>
<p>IBM is not the first company to distribute malware at AusCERT -- Australian telco Telstra did exactly the same thing in 2008.</p>
<p>Risky.Biz confirmed the authenticity of the e-mail message with IBM.</p>
