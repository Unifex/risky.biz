We've got a real bread and butter show for you this week. Troy Hunt will be along to talk about the Cloudflare bug and why everyone freaked out about it, and Haroon Meer of <a href='http://Canary.Tools/' target='new'>Thinks Canary</a> will be along to talk about RSA.

This week's show is, of course, brought to you by Canary.Tools, and Haroon will tell us about his first ever RSA conference experience. That's actually a really fun chat. Funny in parts, too.

Adam Boileau is along to discuss the week's news. Microsoft, Amazon and a handful of Russians are all having an awful, awful week, and he'll be talking all about that.

Links to items discussed in this week's show have moved -- they're now included in this post, below.

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a>, or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
