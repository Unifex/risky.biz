On this week's show we chat with Atlassian's head of security, Daniel Grzelak, all about some AWS security tools he's come up with. He also previews a new tool for generating AWS access key honeytokens at scale, which is really neat.

This week's show is brought to you by Veracode! 

Veracode's director of developer engagement, Peter Chestna, will be along in this week's sponsor interview to have a yarn about some common misunderstandings between security people and developers. We look at misunderstandings both ways.

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest. We talk about all the latest dark markets drama, plus the Great Nuclear Hax Freakout of 2017.
