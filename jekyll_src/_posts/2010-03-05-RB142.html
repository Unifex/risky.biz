<p>Risky Business is hosted by the team at Virtual.Offis in Sydney but sponsored, this week, by Tenable Network Security. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's feature guest is H D Moore, who'll be joining us to talk about some fun stuff he's been doing with NTP. Believe it or not you can use NTP to do massive recon on the Intertubez. H D has built a database of millions of hosts by querying NTP boxens. It's cool.</p>
<p>Tenable Network Security CEO Ron Gula joins us in this week's sponsor interview, and Adam "Beardy McUNIXguy" Boileau drops in to discuss the week's news.</p>
