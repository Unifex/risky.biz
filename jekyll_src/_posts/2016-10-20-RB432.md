On this week's show we're taking a look at the business dealings of John McAfee. Earlier today the NYSE announced the company that arranged to hire McAfee, MGT Capital, would be de-listed from the NYSE: MKT small cap exchange. This follows a class action investor lawsuit and the unearthing of a remuneration agreement between the company and McAfee that have lead some to suggest the whole company could be a pump and dump scam.

This comes hot on the heels of a release of a Showtime documentary that alleges McAfee's involvement in two murders and the rape of a scientist working for him. We'll hear from respected industry analyst Rich Mogull about MGT's proposed product line while Georgetown Law's Visiting Professor Russell Stevenson takes a look at MGT's somewhat strange remuneration agreement with McAfee.

This week's show is brought to you by Canary.Tools.. If you're a regular listener you've heard me sing the praises of Canary in the past. It's basically a little honeypot that you can configure to look like anything, you put it on your LAN somewhere and wait for an attacker to mess with it. It's a great product that's experiencing amazing growth. Canary.Tools head honcho Haroon Meer will be along in this week's sponsor interview to talk about how little hacks can help defenders as well as attackers.

Adam is away on his company retreat this week so I've actually asked Haroon to fill in for him in the news segment, too. It's your double dose of Haroon Meer!

Oh, and do add [Patrick](https://twitter.com/riskybusiness) and [Haroon](https://twitter.com/haroonmeer) on Twitter if that's your thing.
