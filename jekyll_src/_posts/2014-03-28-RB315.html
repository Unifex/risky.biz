<p>This week's feature interview is with nmap creator Gordon Lyon, who's probably better known by his handle: Fyodor.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Last week we brought you the news that the Full Disclosure mailing list was shuttered following legal threats from someone describing themselves as a security researcher. Fyodor runs the seclists.org mailing list archive and he's decided to bring FD back from the dead. I got him on the line and asked him why.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Bridgepoint -- a Queensland-based company that does all sorts of stuff -- systems integration, pen testing and PCI. With the G20 coming up we chat with the company's principal security consultant Michael Trott about the preparations underway. When the world shines its spotlight on Brisbane in November boy oh boy, everyone with a gripe is going to be trying to deface pretty much every website with the word "Queensland" on it. That's coming up soon.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins us to discuss the week's security news headlines. </p>
