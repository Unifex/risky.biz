<p>You're about to hear an interview I recorded with Bob Clark. He currently teaches law at the US Naval Academy, but he's been doing military law for a long time, even serving as the operational attorney for the US Army Cyber Command at one point.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>I posted his talk yesterday... he touched on the Weev vs AT&amp;T trial in that and I thought it would be interesting to get his perspective on the CFAA, precisely because it's not the sort of thing he normally concerns himself with. He has less of an agenda than a defence attorney or a prosecutor.</p>
<p>(If you haven't heard the episode of the regular Risky Business podcast where I had a chat with Weev and recapped that whole thing you might want to check it out because we reference it in this interview. It's <a href="http://risky.biz/RB319">here</a>.)</p>
