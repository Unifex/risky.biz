<p>Hey hey, Risky Business is up, sponsored this week by the fine folks at <a href="http://tenablesecurity.com" target="new">Tenable Network Security</a>. On this week's show we speak to counter-surveillance guru Les Goldsmith from <a href="http://esd-australia.com" target="new">ESD Group Australia</a> about extracting data from mobile phones. If you're someone in a sensitive job, you might want to think twice about taking your phone with you to the Beijing Olympics, Goldsmith says.</p>

<p>Risky Business 66 also features part two of our interview with wireless guru Neal Wise of <a href="http://assurance.com.au" target="new">Assurance.com.au</a>. In this week's section Neal discusses 802.11n headaches, companies becoming complacent after implementing 802.1x, bad security in the name of compliance and more.</p>
<p>This week's sponsor guest is Marcus Ranum from Tenable Network Security, who argues penetration tests seldom represent true value.</p>
<p>During the podcast you'll hear Les Goldsmith mention a National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) paper on mobile phone forensics. It's <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-101/SP800-101.pdf" target="new">here (pdf)</a>. You'll also hear Patrick Gray mention Federal Agent Nigel Phair's Pacific Islands Computer Crime and Security Survey. That one's <a href="http://www.esecurity.net.au/PICCSS08_survey.pdf" target="new">here (pdf)</a>.</p>
