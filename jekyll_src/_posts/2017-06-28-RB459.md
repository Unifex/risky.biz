This week we'll be chatting with Andy Greenberg from Wired about his cover story for that magazine. He travelled to Ukraine back in March to research his story on Russian attacks against the Ukrainian power network. He joins us this week to share the insights he gleaned during his travels.

This week's show is brought to you by SensePost.

SensePost are based in South Africa and England, but they are very well known for offering training courses at Black Hat. This year will be the 17th year they've run training courses there... as can be expected their brand new devops security course has gone absolutely gangbusters in terms of registrations this year, but they're also offering <a href='https://sensepost.com/discover/events/blackhat-usa/ '>a bunch of other courses</a>. They'll be joining us to chat about trends in training in this week's sponsor interview.

Adam Boileau, as always, drops by for the week's news segment. You can add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a>, or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that’s your thing. Show notes are below...
