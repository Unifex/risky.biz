On this week's show we're taking a look at how an acceleration in 24-carat bonkers state-sponsored hacking is leading to calls at senior levels of government for some actual norms to be established. We've got Russia hacking the planet with NotPetya, North Korea owning central banks and cryptocurrency exchanges, China owning the CCleaner supply chain and... well.. it's all getting a bit much.

So in this week's feature segment we're going to zero in on one norm-breaking country, North Korea. We'll hear from John Hultquist of FireEye and Adam Meyers of Crowdstrike on that.

As you'll hear, countries like North Korea are pushing the limits of what they can get away with on the Internet and friendlier states are desperately trying to establish what the boundaries for good faith actors should actually be. We'll hear from Australia's cyber ambassador Tobias Feakin on that part of the discussion, courtesy of some audio gifted to the Risky Business podcast by Australian journalist James Riley. That's a fun package and it's coming up after the news.

This week's sponsor interview is with Zane Lackey of Signal Sciences. Zane joins us to talk about a few things -- how developer teams are increasingly making their own security decisions and how that's actually a good thing... we'll also talk about companies that have found themselves operating on multiple cloud platforms even though they didn't plan for it.

Adam Boileau, as usual, is this week's news guest.

We cover:

* The AMD bugs
* China's tightening grip on security research
* Slingshot APT
* Christopher Wray's mind bogglingly daffy comments on key escrow
* AND MOAR!
