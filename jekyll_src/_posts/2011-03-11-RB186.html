<p>This week's show is jam-packed! We'll be chatting with Andrea Barisani about a presentation he did with Daniele Bianco at CanSecWest this week. They're both from Inversepath, and the title of their talk was "Chip and PIN is definitely broken". Is it? Find out after the news.</p>

<p>Also this week we chat with CSO Adam Pointon. What can you do when your executives want to use their iPad or other mobile device on your network? Is it possible to create a security policy for consumer devices on your network? Well, yeah, it is, as it turns out.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Jack Daniel of Astaro. The topic is IPv6. Despite the fact that the Internet has run out of v4 addresses I haven't personally seen the four horsemen of the Internet failpocalypse riding down my street just yet. But be assured, there's a transition coming and Jack joins us to discuss how you can prepare for it.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, stops by with his take on the week's news.</p>
