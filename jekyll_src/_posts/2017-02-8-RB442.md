There's no feature interview in this week's show. Instead, we're going to spend a bit more time with Adam Boileau talking about the week's news, and there's plenty to chew through.

This week's show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security! In this week's sponsor interview we'll be chatting with Amit Yoran, Tenable's new-ish CEO. Amit has an interesting background in infosec and he'll be joining us to talk about a few things -- Tenable's just launched a whole new platform, which is interesting from a sign-of-the-times perspective. We'll also get his thoughts on where he sees things going in the industry more generally. This isn't Amit's first CEO post -- he was previously the big cheese at Netwitness then RSA, so he certainly has the experience to weigh in on trends.
