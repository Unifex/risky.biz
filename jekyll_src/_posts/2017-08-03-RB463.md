This week's feature interview is with Facebook CSO and Black Hat 2017 keynote speaker Alex Stamos. We'll be digging a little deeper on some of the points he hit on in his talk in Las Vegas this year. I've linked through to a video of his keynote in this week's show notes (below), and I'd really recommend you watch it. It was just very, very good.

This week's show is brought to you by Thinkst Canary. They're best known for their little Canary honeypots, you put them on your network and they'll alert you to all sorts of lateral movement. Thinkst's Founder and chief brain Haroon Meer will be along later on to talk about cloud security. 

He'll be echoing some of the points made in our <a href='https://risky.biz/RB461/'>interview</a> a few week's back with Daniel Grzelak from Atlassian, as well as looking at how you can start to put together a somewhat coherent strategy for detecting when your cloud services get popped. 

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest.
