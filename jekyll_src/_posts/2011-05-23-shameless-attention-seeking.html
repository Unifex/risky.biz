<p>Tony Oliver and the Pubcast crew interviewed me about the talk I did at ITWeb's Security Summit in South Africa the other week.</p>
<p>My talk was all about militarisation trends in the digital security field. I drew parallels between the Cold War and what's happening now. You can find it <a href="http://www.discussit.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=299&amp;Itemid=65" target="new">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Tony and the rest of his gang for having me on their show. It's good to be on the other end of an interview every now and then!</p>
