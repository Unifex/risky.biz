<p>This week's podcast is hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting and sponsored by Tenable Network Security.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Risky Business 108 takes a look at the SDL as it applies to web applications. <a href="http://www.whitehatsec.com/home/index.html" target="new">White Hat Security</a>'s Jeremiah Grossman joins the program to argue <a href="http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2009/05/mythbusting-secure-code-is-less.html" target="new">secure code, in the case of web applications, isn't necessarily cheaper code</a>. It sounds like heresy, but Grossman makes some pretty compelling points during his interview.</p>
<p><a href="http://storm.net.nz" target="new">Adam Boileau</a> joins us to discuss the news headlines, and this week's sponsor interview is with <a href="http://tenablesecurity.com/" target="new">Tenable Network Security</a>'s CSO Marcus Ranum. This week we talk to Ranum about the ridiculousness of the credit card transaction model.</p>
