<p>On this week's show, can you have your cake and eat it too? Is it possible to build a usable instant messenger platform that is secure and immune to traffic and metadata analysis?</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We speak with international man of mystery The Grugq all about creating a platform that ticks these boxes. As it turns out, it can be done. So goodbye Yahoo, MSN, AOL and Skype... hello to something completely new!</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security! In this week's sponsor interview we chat with Jeffrey Man of Tenable about why  using point to point encryption to dodge PCI scope is an awful idea.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, stops by to chat about the week's news. Show notes, including links to the week's news items, can be found <a href="http://risky.biz/RB305_notes">here</a>.</p>
