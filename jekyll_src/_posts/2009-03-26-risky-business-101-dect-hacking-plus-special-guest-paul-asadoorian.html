<p>This week's episode is sponsored by Microsoft and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We're shifting focus a little bit in this week's feature and taking a look at DECT hacking. DECT is the Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications standard, and as you'll hear, it's not always implemented correctly. That can be a lot of fun for the evil guys out there.</p>
<p>Blair Strang will be joining us to talk about that.</p>
<p>Also on this week's show we'll catch up with the host of the PaulDotCom security podcast, Paul Asadoorian. He's popping by to do this week's news segment, and boy, what a week for news it's been.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Internet Explorer product manager, James Pratt, pops by to discuss the new security-related features in the browser in this week's sponsor interview.</p>
