On this week's show we chat with Peter Wesley. Peter's well known around the Australian security scene, but a few years back he relocated to China, where security is booming. He did a presentation at the AusCERT conference on the Gold Coast last week all about the Chinese hacker scene and security industry. He joins us in this week's feature interview to tell us about how the Chinese scene evolved and what its current relationship with the Chinese government looks like.

This week's sponsor interview is a cracker. We'll be joined by Ryan Kalember, Senior Vice President of Strategy with <a href='https://proofpoint.com/'>Proofpoint</a>, the email filtering company. Ryan is along to talk about a phenomenon the Proofpointers are very interested in -- we've all heard of VIPs, but he's here to talk about VAPs -- Very Attacked People.

So much attacker behaviour these days is driven by email-based attacks, and the people getting hit the most with this sort of stuff might not be the ones you expect. Ryan joins us later on for that conversation in this week's sponsor interview, with thanks to Proofpoint.

The show notes/links are below, and you can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
