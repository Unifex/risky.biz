In this week's weekly show we're just going to drill in to the week's extra long security news section with Adam Boileau then go straight to the sponsor interview. I've got a fantastic feature interview for you this week, but I'm going to publish it outside of the news show. It was either that or run stupidly long or cut too much from everything to make it all fit.

This week's sponsor interview is a good one though. We're chatting with the team behind <a href='https://darktrace.com/'>DarkTrace</a>. They make a machine learning-backed network monitor. A key different with this kit is it actually gets involved on the network. If it sees something it's confident is attacker behaviour it will start spraying TCP resets to boot them off the network. 

This is something the IPS systems of old used to do but it's an approach that fell out of favour. We'll find out why that approach was discarded and why it's coming back, as well as generally discuss the role of machine learning in security with a company that has invested in it heavily. This isn't a "for or against" interview segment. This is a discussion with one company that is getting value out of the approach, so stick around for that.

The show notes/news items are below, and you can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
