On this week's show we'll be chatting with Kelly Shortridge, formerly a detection manager at BAE, all about her Black Hat talk. It's all about why most of what you hear about applying game theory to detection strategies is total bullshit.

This week's show is brought to you by Signal Sciences! 

Signal Sciences makes a killer product focussed on web application and web server security. It's really popular with the dev ops crowd, which is interesting, because most security products in devops focus on the dev, whereas Signal Sciences focusses more on the ops component.

This week we speak to Signal Sciences co-founder Zane Lackey about this burgeoning market for security tooling geared towards non-security people. It's actually a really interesting conversation. Non security groups at large organisations are having to become security self sufficient and it really is a game changer. More on that with Zane Lackey in this week's sponsor interview.

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest.
