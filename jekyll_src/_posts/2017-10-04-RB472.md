There is no feature interview in this week's show -- it was a long weekend here in Australia plus a few things came up. But we've got a great show for you anyway. We'll be discussing the week's news headlines with Adam Boileau who's back on deck after a short break, and then we'll get straight into this week's sponsor interview with Lee Weiner of Rapid7. 

He's the Chief Product Officer there and he's joining us this week to explain why so many vendors are suddenly so obsessed with automation and orchestration. It's a trend that actually makes a bunch of sense for a bunch of reasons, but the key is 100% going to be in the execution.

Links to everything are below.

Oh, and you can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
