<p>This week's show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte Virtual Hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>There's no news segment in this week's news section -- Patrick Gray is on holiday in Japan, so this is a pre-recorded show. But it's still a good one!</p>
<p>This week's feature guest is New Zealand-based security researcher Paul Craig. He's just launched <a href="http://ikat.ha.cked.net/" target="new">iKAT</a>, the Interactive Kiosk Attack Tool.</p>
<p>Ever wondered how to pwn one of those Internet kiosks in various lobbies and airports? Tune in to find out! Paul's spent over a year working on iKAT and has just launched it at DEFCON.</p>
<p>This week's sponsor interview is with Tenable Network Security's Chief Security Officer Marcus Ranum. For those who haven't worked in the security industry very long, Marcus is kind of a big deal(tm).</p>
<p>This week we're talking to Marcus about the impact the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) has had on industry practices.</p>
