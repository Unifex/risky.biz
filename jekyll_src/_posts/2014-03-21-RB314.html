<p>On this week's show we're taking a look at some absolutely awesome research by Azimuth Security's Tarjei Mandt on the pseudo random number generators used by iOS 6 and 7. Tarjei has figured out a way to blow away iOS's memory mitigations with some very cool tricks.</p>

<p>This week's show is sponsored by Tenable Network Security, and this week we're joined by Carlos Perez, Tenable's Director of Reverse Engineering in the sponsor slot. He heard last week's interview all about using PowerShell as a post exploitation tool, and as it turns out, he's one of the leading experts out there on using PowerShell to do sneaky stuff. So he'll be along to pretty much pick up where we left off last week. More PowerShell! That's this week's sponsor interview.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, joins us for the week's news headlines.</p>
