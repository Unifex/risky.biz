On this week's show we're chatting with a PR pro who specialises in information security. Melanie Ensign currently works at Uber, but she also served as a security PR for Facebook and before that, AT&T. She drops in this week to talk about how you can work with the PR professionals in your organisation to help tell your security story to the wider world. She also has some great tips for infosec professionals who might be a bit nervous about dealing with journalists.

In this week's sponsor interview we're joined by Julian Fay, the CTO of Senetas.

Senetas has a long history of making layer 2 network encryptors, but they are branching out in all sorts of ways these days. One thing they're doing now is working on approaches to network encryption that play nicely with software-defined WAN. The days of hauling all your network traffic back to a single choke point are numbered -- Julian thinks in the near future you'll have some sort of CPE device that actually implements different types of encryption on different types of traffic crossing your border. So, Senetas has actually built that gear and we'll be hearing about why.

Adam Boileau joins the show to talk about the week's security news:

* Some very cool LTE research
* Equifax manager charged with insider trading
* Ticketmaster's bad week
* The US DoD's very own app store
* Weird, maybe, possibly-but-probably-not OPM-related fraud
* MOAR Rowhammer stuff affecting 'droid handsets
