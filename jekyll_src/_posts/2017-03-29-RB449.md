On this week's show I'll be playing part two of my interview with In-Q-Tel's chief security officer Dan Geer. That's all about machine learning in infosec. Is it actually going to turn into something? Or is it just another infosec thought bubble?

This week's sponsor interview is with Dan Guido of Trail of Bits. 

Trail of Bits is a New York-based security engineering and testing company that does very interesting work. They don't just break apps, they actually work on securing them. With that in mind, Dan's team has been looking at implementing control flow integrity protections to various software projects. So we speak to him about the llvm versus Microsoft control flow guard approach, which is achievable. We also speak to him about mcsema, a tool they developed for reversing binaries into an intermediate language. 

Adam Boileau, as always, joins us to talk about the week's security news.

Links to items discussed in this week's show have moved -- they're now included in this post, below.

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a>, or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
