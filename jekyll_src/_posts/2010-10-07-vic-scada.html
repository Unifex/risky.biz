<p>The Victorian Auditor General has wrapped up its investigation into SCADA security in the transport and water sectors down south.</p>
<p>It found major problems that will surprise absolutely no one. In short, four out of five of the installations examined were nightmarishly insecure. It also found a real lack of awareness among the operators of critical infrastructure that they even have a problem.</p>
<p>A lack of security understanding was on display in New Zealand recently when <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/small-business/news/article.cfm?c_id=85&amp;objectid=10676784" target="new">a spokesperson for Mighty River Power proclaimed</a> the installation was immune to the Stuxnet malware because "we don't run Windows 2000... which we understand is the doorway for the virus".</p>
<p>I'd guess that in some cases more effort is put into securing billing websites for electricity providers than into securing the infrastructure itself, and this report seems to bear that out.</p>
<p>Most pros in the information security industry has known about these problems for a long, long time, but it's great to see them getting some attention at government level.</p>
<p>You can download the PDF from this page <a href="http://www.audit.vic.gov.au/reports__publications/reports_by_year/2010-11/20100610_ict.aspx" target="new">here</a>.</p>
<p>It makes for fascinating reading. The text has an interesting feel and tone to it -- a mixture of disbelief and panic shine through.</p>
<p>I tried getting someone from the auditor general's office to chat with <em>Risky.Biz</em>, but the office has a policy of not commenting on reports. </p>
<p>The office and its staff are shielded from defamation action when writing official reports, but any commentary to the media is not protected.</p>
<p>The timing of all this is borderline freaky in light of all this Stuxnet hoo-ha.</p>
<p>Anyway, have a read yourselves and tell us what you think by commenting <a href="http://risky.biz/forum/vic-auditor-general-scada-mess#comment-form" target="new">here</a>.</p>
