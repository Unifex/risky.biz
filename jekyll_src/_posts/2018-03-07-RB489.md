On this week's show we're chatting with Professor of Law at the University of Maryland Danielle Citron about an article she co-authored on so-called "deep fake" videos. Citron and Bobby Chesney wrote a <a href='https://lawfareblog.com/deep-fakes-looming-crisis-national-security-democracy-and-privacy'>fascinating piece</a> about the privacy and national security implications of this latest trend and we'll be talking to her about that a little bit later on.

In this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with Julian Fay, CTO of this week's sponsor Senetas. We talk to him about how encryption hardware industry is responding to the looming spectre of quantum computing. 

As you'll hear, standards bodies are already rolling out draft implementations of quantum-resistant algorithms that companies like Senetas will be baking into their kit as additional layers of protection. 

Adam Boileau, as usual, is this week's news guest.

We cover:

* Massive memcached DDoS attacks
* Trustico having a bad week
* Reported flaws in 4G/LTE
* Uber breach lawsuit
* ...and more!
