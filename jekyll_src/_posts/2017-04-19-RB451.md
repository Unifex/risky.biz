On this week's show we talk about the latest Shadowbrokers shenanigans with Adam, as well as all the other major security news of the last couple of weeks.

After that we'll be chatting with Adam's colleague at Insomnia Security, Pipes, about the interesting aspects to the dump -- what did it teach us about how NSA rolls? Well quite a lot, as it turns out. And yeah, the N0day bugs aren't the interesting bit.

This week's show is sponsored by Tenable Network Security. This week Tenable's VP of federal, Darron Makrokanis, will be along to talk about how to speed up federal government adoption of new tech -- what's the best way for that to happen? That's this week's sponsor interview!

Links to items discussed in this week's show have moved -- they're now included in this post, below.

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a>, or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
