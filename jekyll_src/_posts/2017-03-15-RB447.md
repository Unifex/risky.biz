On this week's show Patrick and Adam have a look at the surprisingly great report about 0day prepared by RAND Corporation, as well as the other security news of the week. How 'bout dat Struts bug, eh?

Dr. Vanessa Teague of the University of Melbourne also joins the show to talk about the latest developments around computerised voting. Vanessa is an expert on e-voting and she's been in the space for a long time -- she'll be joining us this week to talk about how European authorities have been responding to the risks posed to their elections by outside parties, and we take a look at some voting security ideas for America.

This week's show is brought to you by Netsparker. Netsparker is a black-box web application testing tool that aims to speed up webapp tests through automation. Netsparker's creator Ferruh Mavituna is this week's sponsor guest. He's joining us to basically talk about what you can actually automate in webapp testing, but also about what you can't automate. That's a really interesting chat, one that the pentesters will love I'm sure.

Links to items discussed in this week's show have moved -- they're now included in this post, below.

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a>, or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
