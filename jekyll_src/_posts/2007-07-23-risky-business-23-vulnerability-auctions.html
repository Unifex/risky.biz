<p>Risky Business, your weekly security podcast, is now available for download, thanks to our sponsor Verizon Business Security Solutions, Powered by Cybertrust, and Vigabyte virtual hosting, our hosting partner.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verisign's Rick Howard. Rick works as the intelligence director for the division of Verisign that used to be iDefense. As many of you would have heard, a Swiss company recently set up a vulnerability auction site. As iDefense is well known for trading in vulnerability information, we thought we'd bring on Howard to discuss the trading of vulnerability info.</li>
<li>We'll also hear from Verizon Business security solutions' Apple expert Kevin Long who'll be along to talk about anti-virus software on the OS X operating system.</li>
<li>And, as always, we're joined by Munir Kotadia from ZDNet Australia to discuss this week's news.</li>
</ul>
<p>A note to particularly attentive listeners: Yes, I did get ahead of myself at the conclusion of this week's podcast. This is the 23rd edition of the show, not the 24th!</p>
