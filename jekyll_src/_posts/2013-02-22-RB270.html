<p>On this week's show we're taking a look at the issue of secondary targeting. These days it's borderline likely that attackers who want information on your company's upcoming mergers and acquisition activity won't even bother attacking you to get the intel. They'll go for your law firm instead... or your accountants... or another partner.</p>

<p>CERT Australia Executive Manager Dr. Carolyn Patterson joins the show to talk about that.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Senetas, makers of fine, layer 2 encryption hardware boxens! If you're planning a greenfields development, please, please, please go visit the Senetas website. They're a publicly listed company and they make really good gear. This week's sponsor interview is with Senetas co-founder and CTO Julian Fay, who as you'll discover, really knows what he's talking about.</p>
<p>This week we chat to Julian about the various certification schemes out there -- FIPS, Common Criteria and CAPS. We talk about some of the problems with these schemes, and also about some of the changes that are being made to them. Certification is changing, big time, so make sure you listen to that one.</p>
