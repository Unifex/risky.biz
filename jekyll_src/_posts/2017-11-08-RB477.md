There's no feature interview in this week's edition, just a slightly longer news session with Adam Boileau, then it's straight into this week's sponsor interview.

Adam and I will be speaking about:

* Charges against Russian officials involved in the DNC hack
* Confirmation of Russian involvement in Ukraine artillery targeting app
* Attribution claims in Bad Rabbit campaign
* "Hack Back" bill is picking up steam
* 1 million installations of counterfeit WhatsApp clone
* A properly awful Tor browser bug
* The cryptocurrency comedies/tragedies of the week
* MOAR


Marco Slaviero is this week's sponsor guest. He'll be along with a radical marketing approach: He'll be telling us what Canaries can't do! But you know what? It's a useful thought exercise. He'll also update us on the latest stuff they're doing in the cloud. They've got some new VMWare virtual canaries too.

Links to everything are below, and you can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness' target='new'>Patrick</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
