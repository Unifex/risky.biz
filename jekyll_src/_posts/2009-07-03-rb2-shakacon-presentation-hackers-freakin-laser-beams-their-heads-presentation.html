<p>This podcast is a ripper, it's a presentation by Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>RB2 correspondent Paul Craig was in Hawaii last month for the ShakaCon security conference and he recorded this talk, which looks at side channel attacks using optical sampling of mechanical energy emissions and power line leakage.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Hackers with freakin' laser beams on their freakin' heads is what it means. These guys have developed techniques for sniffing keystrokes out of power lines and via laser beams... you know, the ones on their freakin' heads!</p>
<p>When you're done listening to this, you can <a href="http://risky.biz/netcasts/rb2/rb2-shakacon-interview-hackers-freakin-laser-beams-their-freakin-heads" target="new">download an interview</a> Paul Craig did with these guys about their talk. It's all on RB2!</p>
