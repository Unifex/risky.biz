On this week's show we hear from Jennifer Bisceglie, the CEO of Interos Solutions, a company that recently prepared a report on supply chain security for the US government's US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. Risky Business contributor Brian Donohue caught up with Jennifer to talk about the report and really get an idea of what supply chain risks look like from a macro level. The long and the short of it is the supply chain is already very, very opaque, so governments and the private sector will have to work pretty hard to mitigate the risks involved here.

This week's show is brought to you by Netsparker, the web application security scanning toolmaker. Netsparker was founded nine years ago by this week's sponsor guest, Ferruh Mavituna. He was a pentester who created Netsparker to help him with his own work. But just recently they raised a bundle of cash: US$40m. We'll catch up with him and find out if a webapp scanning company with $40m is like the mule with the spinning wheel. It certainly seems like Ferruh has some ambitious plans. We haven't seen this sort of money being raised by comparable companies so it's definitely interesting stuff.

In this week's news we cover off:

* Mysterious BGP route hijacking for lame Ether theft (??)
* Google disabling domain fronting
* Canadian teen charged with downloading documents from a website
* City of Atlanta spending $2.6m to recover from its ransomware event
* RSA's conference app fail
* White House chaos over Rob Joyce replacement (MAGA!!! MAGAAAAAA!!!!!)
* Much more
