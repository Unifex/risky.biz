<p>CREST is a pretty big deal in the UK. Over there it's an extremely serious series of tests that can give hiring organisations a semi-reliable indication that a tester knows what they're doing. If you don't have your CREST certification, there's work you simply can't do.</p>

<p>But who knows what it'll morph into here -- the jury isn't just out, it hasn't even been empanelled yet. Government involvement isn't usually a good start.</p>
<p>You can read the Attorney General's announcement <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Media-releases/Pages/2012/First%20Quarter/9-March-2012---Standards-for-cyber-security-testing-to-be-introduced-.aspx" target="new">here.</a></p>
<p>Interesting to note that former Australian Federal Police agent (that was years ago now) Alastair MacGibbon is the CEO of CREST Australia. </p>
<p>He has zero background in security testing but his appointment makes sense -- it wouldn't be politically possible to appoint a CEO from a professional services organisation. </p>
<p>This way there's no conflict of interests.</p>
