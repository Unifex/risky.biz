First up in this edition of Snake Oilers we speak with Rapid7. Listeners of the regular show would have heard me talk about their UserInsight software for years. That's because I knew people who used it and they swore by it. UserInsight was user and entity behaviour analytics (UEBA) software that was massively ahead of its time. It was very good at spotting weird things happening on your network when it comes to dumped or compromised creds popping up in weird places.

Well, InsightIDR is basically where UserInsight wound up, and yeah, it's morphed in to a product that's half SIEM and half EDR. 

Every Tom, Dick and Harriett seems to be offering EDR software these days, and every next-gen SIEM company is becoming more and more UEBA-centric, so what Rapid7 has created here is something in between. InsightIDR product manager Eric Sun will tell us all about it.

Next up we'll hear the simplest pitch in this podcast, from Airlock Digital. They're an Australian company that makes whitelisting software that's actually useable. If your organisation has tried implementing whitelisting through Microsoft's Applocker then you know how badly it sucks. These guys have created a simple but useable whitelisting solution. 

I've been to the booth! I've seen the demo! Airlock Digital co-founder David Cottingham is our guest on their behalf. In addition to being a founder, David is also the author of the SANS course SEC480: which covers the ASD top 4 -- number one on that list is whitelisting. He has experience in the federal government implementing whitelisting and after seeing just how badly other products suck, he and his mates founded Airlock Digital. So yeah, if you're whitelist-curious or if you're sick of dealing with Applocker, then you really, really should stick around for that one.

After that we're checking in with Stephan Chenette of AttackIQ. They make attack simulation software, but in response to customer demand they've actually taken it to its logical extension - they're now offering modules you can use to test your SOC staff, or, if you outsource, you can use these modules to test your MSSP. Throw some alerts at them and see what comes back -- get scores for individual SOC operators. Hey, even if you ARE an MSSP you might want to use this software to see who to promote in your SOC. That's interesting stuff.
