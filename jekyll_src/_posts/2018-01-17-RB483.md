On this week's show we chat with Collin Anderson about Iranian internet censorship, as well as how sanctions on Iran led Google to block app engine access within Iran. 

That's a problem for Signal users there, because when the primary Signal servers are blocked, the software falls back to a domain-fronting approach that uses... drum roll please.. Google App Engine.

That's a pretty wide ranging discussion of 'net censorship in Iran and 'net censorship generally and that's coming up after the news.

This week's show is brought to you by Bugcrowd, big thanks to them for that. In this week's sponsor interview we'll chat with Bugcrowd trust and security engineer Keith Hoodlet about some work they've been doing on producing detailed remediation information for their clients. 

Adam Boileau is also along, as always, to discuss the week's security news. The show notes/links are below, and you can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
