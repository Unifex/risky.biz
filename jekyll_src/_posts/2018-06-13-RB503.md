You might have noticed North Korea's been in the news over the last couple of days. Well, we're sticking with the theme -- we've got a great feature interview for you this week with Andrea Berger. She's a senior research associate at the US-based James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies and the co-host of the Arms Control Wonk podcast. This week she speaks with Risky Business contributor Hilary Louise about a report the centre did into North Korea's IT industry.

Yep, they have one, and you'll be surprised by its scope and reach. That's this week's feature interview.

This week's sponsor interview is with Signal Sciences co-founder and CEO Andrew Peterson. Andrew was at a Gartner event in DC last week, and I grabbed some time with him to talk about what's new in DevSecOps, how people are applying various DevSecOps tools, and what the general awareness of good DevSecOps practices is out there. Andrew's prior career was in development, not security. He and Zane Lackey worked together at Etsy and Signal Sciences was very much inspired by the work they both did there. Andrew says analysts are starting to understand that web application security isn't something you drop on to a network in an appliance and things are actually changing.
