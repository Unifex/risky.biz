Risky Business #452 -- Are Wikileaks charges a threat to press freedom?
Brookings fellow and former NSA attorney Susan Hennessey joins the show...


Over the last week or so there's been mounting speculation that the US government is getting serious about preparing charges against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. The question is, could these charges threaten press freedom?

Joining us to discuss that this week is Lawfare's managing editor Susan Hennessey.

This week's show is brought to you by Senetas. Senetas makes layer two encryption equipment, but today they're joining us to talk about some work it's doing with ADVA Optical Networks in marrying its tech with some SDN stuff done at the telco level.

Links to items discussed in this week's show have moved -- they're now included in this post, below.

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a>, or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
