This is the last episode for the year -- the last episode of the 10th season! On this week's show Adam and I will discuss the week's news and then we're going to reflect on the major events in 2016; the stuff that stuck out for us. I don't think it'll come as a surprise that the cyber intrigue surrounding the 2016 US presidential election is what peaked our interest this year.

This week's show is brought to you by Canary.Tools. Canaries are of course those awesome little honeypots you can deploy on your network for excellent signalling. They *will* tell you if you have an attacker on your network, they're cost effective and really nicely designed. 

Canary's very own Marco Slaviero will be along a bit later to talk through a recent Tweetstorm that centred on honeypots, as well as to preview Canary's next release. In a few weeks you will be able to buy a purpose-built ICS honeypot, as well as one that mimics a code repository, so if you work with ICS gear or for a dev shop, you'll really want to tune in to that one.

*****RISKY BUSINESS WILL BE BACK ON JANUARY 12, 2017*****

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
