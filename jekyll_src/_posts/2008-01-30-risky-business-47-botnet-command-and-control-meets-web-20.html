<p>This week's podcast looks at a few interesting topics. Apparently the bad guys are about to ditch IRC as a command and control channel for botnets and start using RSS, blogs and steganography to communicate with their zombie armies... sneakily!</p>

<p>The show is brought to you this week by the fine folks at Check Point Software Technologies and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte.</p>

</ul>
