On this week's show we're chatting with Daniel Gruss an infosec researcher doing a postdoc in the Secure Systems group at the Graz University of Technology in Austria.

Daniel was one of the authors of a recent paper on a new Rowhammer technique. This one's pretty clever, basically because it evades all known detection techniques by executing in an Intel SGX enclave.

In this week's feature interview we chat with Dan Guido from Trail of Bits. He's along this week to talk about his experience in helping to build secure software and security tools for his clients.

Of course the big news this week are the so-called "KRACK" attacks against WPA2. Adam's done his homework on that and joins the news segment to tell you all how bad it is. We also look at the RNG bugs making life hard for smart card vendors and all the other news of the week!

Links to everything are below.
