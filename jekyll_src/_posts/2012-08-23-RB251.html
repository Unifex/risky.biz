<p>In this week's feature interview we're getting an update on some research we looked at last year. Loukas of <a>Assurance.com.au</a> in Melbourne had been playing around with some "evil maid" EFI hacks on Macs, but he's done some more work on them and presented his findings at BlackHat in July.</p>
