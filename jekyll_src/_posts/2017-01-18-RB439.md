On this week's show we're chatting with Alec Muffett about an absolutely awful bit of journalism run by The Guardian. Unless you've been hiding under a rock the last few days you would have seen a story circulating about a supposed government-friendly backdoor in the popular messaging app WhatsApp. Alec joins us this week to explain why that story is, put simply, bullshit.

This week's show is brought to you by Senetas, makers of layer 2 encryption gear. Senetas co-founder and CTO Julian Fay is along for the sponsor interview and we're talking to him about what the charge to the cloud means for things like network encryption. Julian listened to last week's interview with Rich Mogull, and he has some thoughts he'd like to share.

Also this week, a new segment that I hope will become regular -- story corner, with Jake Davis. Do stick around for that at the closing of this week's show.

Adam Boileau, as usual, joins us for this week's news segment.

Links to everything are in this week's <a href='http://risky.biz/RB439_notes'>show notes</a>.

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
