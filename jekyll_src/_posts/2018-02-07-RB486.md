On this week's show we're chatting with Travis McPeak at Netflix about a tool they've developed called RepoKid. It automatically strips unused AWS permissions, which I'm guessing a lot of you will find quite useful.

We'll also chat with Dan Kuykendall in this week's sponsor interview. Dan works for Rapid7, and they've been doing some interesting stuff with their agents, basically tweaking them to give better visibility of application security issues and exploitation attempts. T

hat conversation is really about how security firms these days are using the agent footprint they have to just do whatever they can.

Adam Boileau, as always, pops in to discuss the week's news. We cover the:

* AutoSploit arm waving
* Lauri Love beating extradition
* Nik Cubrilovic's arrest
* MOAR

The show notes/links are below, and you can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
