<p>This week's episode of Risky Business is the second last for the year!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's feature interview we're chatting with Neal Wise about his "one finger punch". </p>
<p>Neal's done some really interesting work in hacking Cisco firmware and the exploit he's developed is literally a two word command that gives you unrestricted access to a whole bunch of Cisco kit. It's not a massive story or anything. It's just funny. </p>
<p>Tenable Network Security's CEO Ron Gula pops along for this week's sponsor interview. He recently keynoted the SANS Incident Detection Summit. Incident response is its own field with its own quirks and Ron wound up having some very interesting conversations with the other attendees. So I got him on the line and asked him to recap the event for us.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, is this week's news guest.</p>
