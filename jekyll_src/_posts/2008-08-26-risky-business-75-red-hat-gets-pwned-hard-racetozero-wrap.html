<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by Check Point Software.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's news segment we take a long, hard, disapproving look at the "Red Hat incident". It seems the software-maker was fairly thoroughly pwned -- the attackers managed to compromise the package signing boxes for both Fedora Core and Red Hat. </p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>We also check in with RaceToZero virus obfuscation contest organiser <strong>Simon Howard</strong>. Until now the focus has been on the performance of the contest entrants, but how did the actual anti-virus software hold up? What's good and what sucks?</p>
<p>Simon is back from hosting <a href="http://racetozero.net" target="new">RaceToZero</a> at DEFCON in Vegas and joined the show by phone from New Zealand.</p>
<p><strong>Steve McDonald</strong> is this week's sponsor guest from Check Point Software, and <strong>Munir Kotadia</strong> joins us from <a href="http://zdnet.com.au/news" target="new">ZDNet Australia HQ</a> for a look at the week's news.</p>
<p>If you'd like to read the Popular Mechanics interview with the MIT "subway hackers," as mentioned on the show, it's <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4278892.html" target="new">here</a>.</p>
