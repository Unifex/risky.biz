Adam Boileau has some out of town business to handle this week so he can't join us in the news segment. But that's ok, because industry legend Haroon Meer has very kindly agreed to fill in for him! We chat to Haroon shortly about all the latest NotPetya developments, we'll also talk about the drama Kaspersky is experiencing right now, as well as dissecting the latest battle reports from the cryptowar! All the news is covered.

This week's show is brought to you by <a href='https://icebrg.io/?utm_source=riskybiz&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=networksecurity' target='new'>ICEBRG</a>!

ICEBRG's co-founder, Will Peteroy, joins the show this week to chat a bit about what they're up to. Will has an interesting background. He was the technical director of a government agency Red Team. That meant red team exercises against agencies, but he was also responsible for doing assessments on security products. He also put in a bunch of time at Microsoft where he was the endpoint for product security for Windows and Internet Explorer, which meant he was the recipient of oh-so-much-0day for around a year and a half. So yeah, Will knows what he's doing, and he's made a thing, and you're going to hear about that thing after this week's news.

See links to show notes below, and follow <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/haroonmeer'>Haroon</a> on Twitter if that's your thing!
