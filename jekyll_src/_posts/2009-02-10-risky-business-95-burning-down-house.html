<p>This week's podcast is sponsored by Tenable Network Security and hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we chat to the head of iDefense Labs, Rick Howard. He joins us to discuss the threat posed to organisations from disgruntled ex-staff. Layoffs have been ramping up, and we've already seen two high-profile incidents involving cranky admins burning down the house, or at least trying to.</p>
<p>Rick also chimes in with his predictions for 2009.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview we chat to Tenable Network Security's CEO Ron Gula, who'll fill you all in on the new, whiz-bang bundle containing Immunity Inc's CANVAS exploitation tool and Tenable's own Nessus software.</p>
<p>This week's news is huge. Munir Kotadia joins us from a small resort island off the coast of Malaysia to discuss the headlines. No joke. Bastard.</p>
