This week's Risky Business is kind of going back to its roots a bit. As much as we love talking about policy and the intersection of cyber security with global affairs, sometimes it pays to remember that computer security is actually about computers.

With that in mind this week we've got two fantastic interviews for you. We'll be chatting with Dr. Silvio Cesare in this week's feature interview. Silvio's dusted off his bug hunting hat and he's taken to Twitch-streaming his auditing sessions. Dave Aitel described watching Silvio's Twitch stream as like seeing a Titan ransack a small Greek village. Five months, 100 bugs, 50 of them in kernel stuff. 

He's doing this for a couple of reasons -- he wants to show people how it's done, and he wants people to realise there are still lots of bugs out there to be found. We'll chat to him about that in this week's feature.

This week's sponsor interview is with another old school hacker, Stephen Ridley. Stephen is the founder of Senrio, which is technically an IoT security play, but the thing is the tech he's developed has turned out to be useful for all sorts of other stuff too.

Senrio is another one of those hacker-led startups in the spirit of Duo Security or Thinkst Canary. Stephen is a really well respected guy and this week he's joining us to talk about a bunch of stuff. A lot of it is related to the unexpected uses for Senrio's monitoring platform. He built a classifier for network-connected devices as a part of Senrio's IoT security platform, and it turns out it's actually running rings around a bunch of Enterprise Asset Management tools. People are actually using his IoT security monitoring solution to do asset management and figure out install gaps for their EDR solutions.

Totally not what he intended people to use it for, but hey, a win's a win. So Stephen joins us this week to talk about that, also to talk about recent developments in the IoT space and really a bunch more stuff.
