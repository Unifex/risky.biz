<p>This week's podcast is brought to you by Tenable Network Security and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>It's a special day for us at Risky Business HQ -- we've launched our new Web site: <a href="http://risky.biz/" title="http://risky.biz/">http://risky.biz/</a></p>
<p>We now publish two podcasts, video and written news and opinion. There's also forums, so by all means go and sign up for an account! We'll see you in there.</p>
<p>On this week's show we're talking to L0pht/@stake/Veracode co-founder Chris Wysopal about the rebirth of L0phtCrack, the legendary password cracking package.</p>
<p>In this week's sponsor interview, Tenable Network Security analyst and Open Security Foundation dude Brian "Jericho" Martin pops in for a chat about dataloss -- are you more likely to lose data through a USB key, lost laptop or an actual attack?</p>
<p>Adam Pointon also pops by for a look at the week's news.</p>
