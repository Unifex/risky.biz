On this week's news we put Wikileaks' latest dumps under the microscope and offer a few theories on what's really going on.

We also have a chat with Mike Arpaia, the creator of osquery. osquery is host-based instrumentation software put together by Mike and his team when they worked at Facebook. It's open source these days and now Mike is trying to get it adopted.

This week's show is brought to you by Cyberark! And we'll be chatting with Cyberark's Chief Architect Gerrit Lansing. Cyberark makes software that manages privileged accounts, and we'll be talking to Gerrit about privileged account management automation in this week's sponsor interview.

Adam Boileau is along to discuss the week's news.

Links to items discussed in this week's show have moved -- they're now included in this post, below.
