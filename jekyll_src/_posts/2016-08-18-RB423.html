<p>This week's feature interview is incredible. We're speaking with David Wang from Azimuth Security. He, his colleague Tarjei Mandt and Mat Solnik of OffCell Research delivered an absolutely blockbuster talk at Black Hat. I didn't see the talk at the time but I got a chance to review the slides and oh-my-god I can't believe this one got so little attention.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>While everyone was running around talking about hackable lightbulbs, jeeps and trucks, these three guys basically dropped a how2pwn guide for Apple's Secure Enclave Processor. So, you know, you can basically take their slide deck, add a couple of little tweaks and you're unlocking an iPhone 6s and messing around with a thing you're really not supposed to be messing around with. It's really, really good reversing work and you need to hear this interview.</p>
<p>This week's show is brought to you by Bugcrowd, outsourced bug bounty programs. Bugcrowd founder and CEO Casey Ellis is along this week to talk about Apple's newly launched bounty program. Even though other software companies already have bounty programs, the large rewards involved in this one make it a big deal. We'll get his thoughts on that.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau joins us in this week's news segment to discuss the NSA's shiny toys being all over teh torrentz, as well as other assorted infosec news.</p>
<p>Oh, and do add <a href="https://twitter.com/riskybusiness">Patrick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/metlstorm">Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.</p>
