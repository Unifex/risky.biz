On this week's show we chat with James Kettle of Portswigger Web Security about some adventures he had with reverse proxies and malformed host headers. Using some simple tricks, James was able to do some craaaazy stuff and earn himself about $30k in bounties. He's turned some of his techniques into tools for Burp Suite, so he'll be joining us to talk about that.

In this week's sponsor interview we're tackling the new European general data protection regulation. With the new regime due to kick in on May 25 next year, there's a lot of angst out there, and for good reason. The penalties for mishandling info are up to 4% of global turnover, which is a stiff enough penalty to strike fear into the hearts of CEOs everywhere.

Senetas' is this week's sponsor. They make layer 2 encryption gear, as well as SureDrop, a GDPR and enterprise friendly dropbox-style service. Senetas Europe's managing director Graham Wallace joins the show this week to talk about some of the ins and outs of GDPR. Stay tuned for that.

As usual, Adam Boileau also joins the show to talk about the week's security news. Links to everything are below.
