We've got a real bread-and-butter show for you this week. Adam is along in this week's news segment to talk about the latest on the Intel AMT bugs, Tavis Ormandy's horror-show Windows Defender bug, the Macron email dump and more.

In this week's feature interview we speak with Adobe security engineer and OAuth 2 in Action co-author Antonio Sanso about what companies like Google might be able to do to make their OAuth implementations a little safer for users... Which, you know, might be something worth considering given an OAuth-based phishing attack was able to compromise something like a million Google accounts the other week.

This week's show is brought to you by Thinkst Canary! Canary is of course the wonderful little hardware honeypot device Thinkst makes that you can plug into your network that'll let you know when you have attackers on your LAN. Thinkst's head of development, Macro Slaviero, joins the show this week to talk about the CIA's leaked watermarking solution Scribbles, as well as to talk a little about Thinkst's so-called "bird guide". It's a document (linked below) with a bunch of advice for those of you considering using Honeypots.

Links to items discussed in this week’s show have moved – they’re now included in this post, below.

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a>, or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that’s your thing.
