On this week's show we're looking at an issue that kicked up last week when creepware scumbags Flexispy announced they were moving their bug bounty program to HackerOne. VICE journalist Joseph Cox asked HackerOne CEO Marten Mickos if he'd be happy to host their program, and his answer is as follows:

"Any company that operates legally within its jurisdiction, treats our hackers with respect and takes vulnerability disclosure seriously is generally welcome to run their program on the HackerOne platform. Improving the integrity of all connected software is to the benefit of the digital society."

A lot of people, myself included, didn't react so well to that line of thinking. HackerOne CTO Alex Rice suggested he come on the show to talk about the company's stance. As you'll hear, Alex is pushing a much softer line than his CEO, but still says this is complicated. Stay tuned for that, at times, excruciating interview.

This week's sponsor interview is with Signal Sciences CSO and co-founder Zane Lackey. Zane was the head of security at Etsy, but he moved on to found Signal Sciences, a company that is making webapp security software that by all reports is pretty damn good.

He joins us in the sponsor slot this week to talk about Devops, WAFs and a whole bunch of other fun stuff.

Adam Boileau, as usual, drops by to discuss the week's news.
