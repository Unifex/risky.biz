On this week's show we're taking a deep dive into the latest news about Kaspersky and its alleged ties to Russian security services. The New York Times has just published an absolutely blockbuster piece that claims Israeli intelligence infiltrated Kaspersky's network in 2014 and uncovered slam dunk evidence the company was operating espionage campaigns on behalf of the Russian government. We'll jump into that in a minute, then in this week's feature I'll chat with Dave Aitel of Immunity Inc and get his feelings on the Kaspersky controversy.

Casey Ellis is this week's sponsor guest. He's joining us this week to talk about how people running their own bug bounties can avoid false negatives. A couple of weeks back we ran a feature here on the show about a guy who had a pretty hard time reporting a legitimate security bug to Microsoft. Casey will be along with some ideas on how companies might do better when managing a lot of inbound bug reports, many of which are bogus. How do you sort the wheat from the chaff.
