<p>This week's show is brought to you by Rapid7, big, big thanks to them.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's sponsor interview is with Rapid7's Chief Research Officer HD Moore. But you know what? One interview with HD just isn't enough, is it? So he's also joining us in the feature segment to discuss a project I'm putting together called Invisible.im.</p>
<p>It's an instant messenger system that I designed... it feels very, very weird saying that because I suffer from acute imposter syndrome, but yeah, I designed an IM system for journalists and other privacy conscious people and HD actually made it work! He has created a prototype, and much to everyone's surprise it actually works... we're on to something, so he'll be along after the news to talk about<br/>
invisible.im!</p>
<p>Then we're going to chat with HD some more in this week's sponsor interview. The research team at Rapid7's has been doing some really interesting work on massive internet scanning. That sort of thing has become pretty trendy in the last couple of years, but the Rapid7 team have really pushed this stuff towards the<br/>
cutting edge. They've also discovered some hilarious vulnerabilities out there in the process. Rapid7's Mark Schloesser will be at BlackHat to talk about their latest research, but HD joins the show today to preview it.</p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins us for a check of the week's news headlines.</p>
