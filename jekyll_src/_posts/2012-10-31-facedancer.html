<p>This podcast is an interview I did at the Breakpoint security conference with security researcher Travis Goodspeed. He's come up with a hardware device called FaceDancer that allows him to capture USB device firmware by emulating the devices. What can you do with that? Well, you can start messing with those devices, loading up custom firmware, and even use modified USB devices to attack hosts.</p>
