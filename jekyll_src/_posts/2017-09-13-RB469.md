On this week's show, of course, we'll be using the news segment to take a look at the dumpster fire that is the Equifax breach. We've got suspicious short trades, executive share sales and an absolutely shambolic response. This one's got the lot; something for everyone.

We'll also take a look at these latest Bluetooth bugs and of course we'll recap the rest of the week's security news.

In this week's feature interview we're chatting with <a href='https://twitter.com/emilymaxima'>Emily Crose</a>. After cutting her teeth at CIA, NSA and US Cyber Command, these days Emily works in the private sector, and her hobby at the moment is using machine learning-based image processing to identify problematic social media images.

Some social media companies say it's too hard to identify, for example, ze Nazis. Emily says nope.

I would say this week's show is brought to you by Tenable Network Security, but now I'm just going to say Tenable because these days that's what they're calling themselves. And it makes sense. Vulnerability management isn't really just about what's on your network anymore. 

With that in mind, they've really changed the messaging of the company. They're not calling it continuous monitoring anymore, they're calling it cyber exposure measurement. Corey Bodzin, VP of product operations at Tenable joins the show to walk us through the rationale behind the new messaging.

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest.
