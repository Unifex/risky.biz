<p>On this week's show we're speaking with Philippe Langlois. You may remember him as the founder of Qualys in the 90s, but these days he's the CEO and founder of P1 Security, a telecommunications security firm. He'll be joining us to discuss the NSA and GCHQ operation against SIM card manufacturer Gemalto.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Last week The Intercept reported on some Snowden dox that said NSA and GCHQ were basically scooping up SIM card private keys from anywhere they could, including from within Gemalto's network. Because cellphone encryption schemes are symmetric, this is bad. It's very, very bad. We'll talk to Philippe about that.</p>
<p>This week's show is sponsored by Palo Alto Networks, big thanks to them. PAN CSO Rick Howard will be along in this week's sponsor interview to talk about one of his passion projects, the Cybersecurity Canon. It's basically his book club idea that PAN is now sponsoring and it's got a LOT of potential. Find out how you can get involved in this week's sponsor interview, with big thanks to Palo Alto Networks.</p>
