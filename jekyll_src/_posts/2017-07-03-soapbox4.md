In this edition of the Risky Business Soap Box podcast we chat with the founder and CEO of Bugcrowd, Casey Ellis, about the establishment of the bug bounty market and how things have shaped up. We also look at where it's going.

The days of bounty programs being operated solely by large technology firms are long gone. Casey predicted that shift years ago. The question becomes, where will bounty programs be in three years from now?

Well, Casey doesn't shy away from making some bold predictions. He thinks most enterprises will have vulnerability reporting mechanisms within two years, and a substantial proportion of those will offer rewards to bug hunters via companies like Bugcrowd.

He also sees bounty programs increasingly serving the specialist market.
