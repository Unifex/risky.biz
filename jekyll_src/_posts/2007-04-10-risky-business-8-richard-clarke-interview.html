<p><img align="left" src="http://www.itradio.com.au/pics/cybertrust_logo.gif"/>Former White House security advisor Richard A. Clarke chats about technology and national security. He was a special advisor to Bill Clinton on counter terrorism, then he worked for George W. Bush.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Clarke became a controversial figure when he published a scathing account of his time working for President Bush, <em>Against All Enemies,</em> in 2004.</p>
<p>In that book he accused Bush of ordering him to link the 9/11 attacks in the US to Iraq, and says his warnings about Al Qaeda's intention to attack the United States went unheeded.</p>
<p>Between 2001 and 2003, he was also George W. Bush's cyber security tsar. If you want a run down on national security aspects of technology, Clarke is extremely well qualified.</p>
<p>His most recent book, <em>Breakpoint</em>, is a fictional thriller which explores the impact current and emerging technologies are having on national security.
