On this week's show we'll be talking about a whole bunch of stuff -- the FBI taking down a botnet in a very FBI way, we go deep on the Trisis malware popping up in the US following America's withdrawal from the so-called Iran agreement. We look at the latest in the crypto debate, breaches, bugs and more!

We'll hear from Tom Uren of Australia's Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) on the Trisis side of things. Tom worked in an interesting place in Australia's defence department but these days spends his days think tanking for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. He shares his thoughts on what it is Iran could be up to with Trisis.

This week's show is brought to you by: Australia! 

AustCYBER is a government-supported industry group here that is trying to get the Australian cybersecurity industry organised. There's the VC-backed US model, the build a "cyber city" in the desert Israeli model, then there's the Australia model, which is actually quite different. It's much more about helping local startups win deals locally, then internationally, to get them on a path to profitability so they don't have to sign the awful term sheets Australian VCs put in front of them. 

Well, there's more to it than that, but AustCYBER head honcho Michelle Price will be along in this week's sponsor interview to walk us through what she's trying to do for the Australian security industry and how foreign multinational companies can also benefit from that.
