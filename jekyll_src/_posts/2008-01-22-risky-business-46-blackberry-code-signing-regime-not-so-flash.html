<!--excerpt-above-->

<ul>
<li>Our favourite newshound, ZDNet Australia's Munir Kotadia, discusses the week's news</li>
<li>This week's feature interview is with Graeme Neilson of Aura Software Security and we're talking BlackBerrys. Aura's developed a trojan for the gadget that Neilson uses in security audits -- he describes it as BackOriface (remember that?) for the BlackBerry -- and if you thought getting badware to run on the mobile devices is hard, you're sadly mistaken</li>
<li>Symantec's Rob Pregnall joins host Patrick Gray to talk about a new banking trojan that side-steps two factor authentication in this week's sponsor interview</li>
<li>Risky Business takes a quick look at some questionable marketing tactics being used by an anti-spyware software manufacturer during a chat with Netregistry CEO Larry Bloch</li>
