In this week's show we're going to have a chat with former NSA general counsel and cyberlaw podcast host Stewart A Baker. We'll get his thoughts on what a Trump presidency could mean when it comes to cyber security.

This week's show is sponsored by Senetas, and you know what? They're branching out. Senetas has some new goodies that can replace all the crappy tools like dropbox that are in your organisation despite you not approving of them. The Senetas solution is actually good enough that it's being used to handle classified data, because hey, Senetas does a lot of business with SafeNet, which is owned by Gemalto -- so if the idea of a HSM-authenticated and locked down dropbox-style platform appeals, hang about for this week's sponsor interview!

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest. Links to everything are in this week's <a href='http://risky.biz/RB435_notes'>show notes</a>.

Oh, and do add <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
