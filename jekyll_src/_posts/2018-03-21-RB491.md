What a week, huh? As you'll soon hear it's been an absolute monster week for infosec news. Top of the list is the Cambridge Analytica scandal. For those who haven't had time to catch up on this one, a former staffer from the data analytics firm has given some interviews in which he says the company scraped 50 million Facebook profiles and used that data to target US voters with political messages on behalf of Donald Trump's campaign. Obviously this has made people feel quite uncomfortable, everyone is mad at Facebook and it's news everywhere.

It also looks like Facebook CSO Alex Stamos is on his way out due to events entirely unrelated to this. 

Also in this week's show we've got:

* Iranians trying to blow up Saudi Arabian chemical plants
* Americans blaming Russia for attacks on its energy grid
* Kaspersky blowing LIVE SOCOM ops against Al Qaeda and the remnants of Islamic State
* The UK vowing to exact revenge on Russia via "cyber" retaliation over the Skripal affair

There is no feature interview in this week's show, we're going long on news, but this week's sponsor interview is absolutely fantastic. It's with Haroon Meer, head honcho over at Thinkst Canary. 

He's not here to talk about anything really related to products this week, instead we're going to talk about CISO stuff. He'll be thoughtlording the absolute sh*t out of you all this week. 

Haroon thinks breached organisations are getting off too lightly in the current infosec climate because people are scared to victim shame. As you'll hear, he thinks there's just no excuses for how some high profile data breaches have occurred and says more CSOs should be prepared to die on the right hills to stop their companies engaging in straight up suicidal behaviour. It's great for security to be an enabler, but that doesn't mean signing off on whatever anyone wants to do.
