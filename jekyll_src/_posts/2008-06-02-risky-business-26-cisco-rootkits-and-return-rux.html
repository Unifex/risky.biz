<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by RSA Security and hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>There's no news segment in this week's show -- by the time you download this podcast, host Patrick Gray will be climbing a cliff somewhere in southern Thailand thanks to the marvelous wonder that is pre-recording and the time-stamp feature in WordPress.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this week's show tills some fun ground, including the recent Flash-based exploit doing the rounds in the wild, Cisco rootkits, the hysteria over the potential reverse engineering of an IOS SSH patch, the return of Ruxcon and more.</p>
<p>Guests on this week's show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Juniper Networks security boffin Steve Manzuik</li>
<li>Ruxcon lead organiser Chris Spencer</li>
<li>RSA Security's Greg Singh pops by in this week's sponsor interview</li>
</ul>
