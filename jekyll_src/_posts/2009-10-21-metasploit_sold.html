<p>The Metasploit project has been acquired by Rapid7, a US-based vulnerability management company.</p>
<p>Metasploit creator H D Moore confirmed the sale in a podcast interview with Risky.Biz overnight (<a href="http://risky.biz/RB128/">Click to hear the podcast</a>). "This is more of a buy in than a sell out," he told Risky.Biz "It's about taking Metasploit to the next level with a real company with real funding."</p>
<p>Eager to put open source enthusiasts' minds at ease, Moore told Risky.Biz the acquisition will result in full time resources being allocated to the Metasploit project. <a href="http://rapid7.com/" target="new">Rapid7</a> will fund five full time developers to work on the project and Moore insists all core software developed by the new, full time team will remain free and open source. </p>
<p>"Nothing that people are using today is going away," he said. " I'm definitely in it for the long haul."</p>
<p>Rapid7 director of products and operations, Corey Thomas, insists the company is committed to the future of Metasploit as an open source project. He says the acquisition seemed a natural progression following partnership and integration discussions with Moore. </p>
<p>"We [already had] two or three developers who contribute to Metasploit," he said. "After a period of time we decided the best way to go was to make a direct investment and fully sponsor the <a href="http://metasploit.com/" target="new">Metasploit project</a>."</p>
<p>Originally released in 2003, Metasploit allows security professionals to rapidly develop exploits for computer vulnerabilities. Initially regarded as controversial, Metasploit has become a staple tool for penetration testers and other technical security professionals.</p>
