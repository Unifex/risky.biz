On this week's show we're going to take a look at the ICO bubble. We'll hear some excerpts from a chat I had with Coinjar CEO Asher Tan and then Adam and I are going to talk about what the hell is happening with all this crypto madness. We also take a look at the scuttling of the Kenyan election over hacking fears, the latest drama with Kaspersky being caught in the middle of geopolitical intrigue, the FSB's unconventional BBQ in San Francisco and more.

This week's show is brought to you by Netsparker. 

Netsparker makes an automated webapp testing tool, you can kinda dial up the level of automation you want. They have a few nice tricks in their suite, too, like auto proof of concept exploitation of some bug classes so you can actually prove people need to fix stuff while you drink coffee, that's nice.

In this week's sponsor interview we're speaking with Ferruh Mavituna, the founder and CEO of Netsparker, about automated testing at scale. It's a sponsor interview, but it's also a pretty generic chat about how you tackle that problem. Basically he says when you're doing this scanning at scale you really can start with the bad, dumb stuff, because if you're in an enterprise of any sort of size at all your automated testing is going to spit out a horror-show list.
