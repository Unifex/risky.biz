Here it is -- this week's feature interview with Marisa Emerson! Marisa is a security researcher who did a great talk at BSides Canberra in March all about game cheating.

She was specifically talking about the cheating techniques PUBG gamers are using and just how advanced they are. The crazy thing is the cheaters here are rolling some pretty decent techniques. It's reminiscent of the iPhone jailbreaking scene -- a lot of good hackers who don't know they're good hackers.

Marisa is running a binary exploitation bootcamp in Brisbane that will have another session next semester. Details are <a href='http://deadbeefsociety.org/bootcamp.html'>here</a>.
