On this week's show we're taking a look at some recent data out of Microsoft trumpeting its Defender antivirus install figures on Windows. They've got 18% market share on windows 7/9 and 50% on Win10.

For the AV and endpoint security industry Microsoft has always been the existential threat, but has the plane flown into the mountain already? We'll speak with Securosis analyst and DisruptOps founder Rich Mogull about that in this week's feature interview.

In this week's sponsor interview we're joined by the always entertaining Haroon Meer of Thinkst Canary. When we spoke Haroon had just wrapped up his first ever booth at the RSA conference. He'll join us this week to tell us, surprisingly, that it was a really worthwhile exercise for Thinkst, but as you'll hear he also thinks the broader industry can be a pack of dumbasses when it comes to actually marketing tech at events like RSA. If he becomes global ruler RSA booths will be gimmick-free and just show people product demos.
