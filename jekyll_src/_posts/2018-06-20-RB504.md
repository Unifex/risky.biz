On this week's show we're chatting with Alex Tilley. He's with Secureworks in Australia these days, but before that he spent a big chunk of his career with the Australian Federal Police.

He did a presentation a few weeks back at the AusCERT conference all about what fraud crews are up to these days. He'll be joining us to walk through how much damage West African crime groups are doing with compromised office 365 accounts. We also talk a bit about trends in money muling, because that game has really changed.

This week's show is brought to you by Cylance, and in this week's sponsor interview we'll be chatting with Cylance's very own Jim Walter about how ransomware hasn't really gone anywhere, despite most of the tech press getting sick of writing about it.

Adam Boileau, as usual, joins us to talk about the week's news, including:

* The Vault7 guy is totally screwed
* US Senate scuttles Trump's plan to save ZTE
* Chinese pwning satellite comms, telcos
* Olympic Destroyer crew is back

Links to everything are below and you can follow <a href='http://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
