<p>Our coverage of AusCERT's 2009 conference is sponsored by Microsoft, and so we're doing these sponsored interviews about Microsoft stuff.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>But that's ok, because it's all interesting!</p>
<p>In this interview with Microsoft's Secure Development Lifecycle big kahuna, Steve Lipner, we discuss the company's decision to release an SDL template for Visual Studio that allows third party developers to use Microsoft's SDL workflow.</p>
<p>It will hopefully mean fewer bugs in non-Microsoft Windows apps sometime in the future!</p>
