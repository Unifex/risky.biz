<p>This week's show is sponsored by Microsoft and hosted by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we chat with Jose Nazario, the manager of security research for Arbor Networks. Jose is joining us to talk about the latest trends in botnet C&amp;C. Apparently, using IRC is sooooo 2005 these days...</p>
<p>We also talk to Stuart Strathdee from Microsoft in this week's sponsor segment. In it, we discuss alleged criminal mastermind and all round badass Albert "The SoupNazi" Gonzalez. Will his capture and prosecution be a deterrent or an inspiration to fraudsters?</p>
<p>And of course the show wouldn't be complete without Adam "Metlstorm" Boileau jumping on board for a look at the week's news headlines.</p>
