<p>This week's Risky Business podcast is brought to you by Check Point Software and hosted, as always, by Vigabyte virtual hosting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this week's show we speak to one of the pioneers of cash-for-vulnerability business practices -- <a href="http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/team/dendler" target="new">David Endler</a>. He's the director of <a href="http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/" target="new">TippingPoint's DVlabs</a> and the founder and chairman of the <a href="http://www.voipsa.org/" target="new">VoIP Security Alliance</a>. He popped by to talk about the latest trends in bug shopping.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is what Endler has to say about buying bugs in software-as-a-service applications like Salesforce.com. While TippingPoint would look at buying vulnerabilities in online applications, he doesn't want to be seen to be encouraging any law breaking. It's a bind!</p>
<p>On this week's podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZDNet Australia editor Munir Kotadia discusses the week's news with host Patrick Gray</li>
<li>TippingPoint DVlabs director David Endler discusses the market for software as a service bugs</li>
<li>Check Point's Steve MacDonald drops by to share his perspective on recent comments made by RSA Security's president Art Coviello in this week's sponsor interview</li>
</ul>
