<p>This week's edition of Risky Business is brought to you by the fine folks at Check Point Software. They've been making firewalls since 1645!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>On this week's show we take a look at the issue of mobile security. You'll hear an excerpt from Fionnbharr Davies' talk at Ruxcon in which he outlines the horror that is an iPhone turned against its master.</p>
<p>After that we check in with Rick Howard, the director of iDefense Labs' in the USA. Despite every vendor under the sun predicting the birth of the mobile hacking age since the year 2000, Rick says 2009 is shaping up as the real deal.</p>
<p>Steve MacDonald from Check Point also swings by for this week's sponsor interview -- the topic? Firewall optimisation software. It's hot right now. So hot. Hot like Hansel.</p>
<p>Risky Business will be late next week -- expect it to be up on Friday. If you'd like to leave feedback for our audio mailbag, you can ring: </p>
