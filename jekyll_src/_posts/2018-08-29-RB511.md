We're going to stick with the revised format this week -- we're going long on news with Adam, then diving right in to the sponsor interview with Zane Lackey of Signal Sciences.

A bunch of you heard my long form, Soap Box interview with Zane from <a href='https://risky.biz/soapbox15/' target='new'>a few weeks back</a>. We're extending that interview out a bit in this week's interview. Zane will be outlining what he thinks needs to change in DevSecOps tooling and workflow for things to really work nicely -- it's just a solid 12 minutes of good thinking and advice, that interview, so do stick around for it.

Adam Boileau will join the show to recap the week's news:

* Australia and Japan to ban Huawei from their 5G builds
* Struts bug: Big deal or meh?
* Voting machine maker ES&S rebuked by researchers AND US gov
* The DNC phish that wasn't
* Recapping Andy Greenberg's Maersk/Notpetya coverage
* Instagram adds real 2FA
* Windows privesc 0day on teh twittarz
* T-Mobile pwned harder than it initially admitted
* Log in to Windows with Google accounts
* Some hilarious Lazarus group shenanigans
* Much, much more

Links to everything that we discussed are below, including the discussions that were edited out. (That's why there are extras.) You can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
