Regular listeners would know Risky Business is just running the news and sponsor segments at the moment so there's no feature interview in this week's show. But that's fine because we've got plenty to get through in the news segment with Adam Boileau.

Then we've got a killer sponsor interview for you this week with Nick Steele and James Barclay of Duo Security.

They're here to talk about WebAuthn. It's the new authentication spec currently going through the W3C process. Both Nick and James will be along later to talk about what the spec is designed to do, how it works and what its chances of becoming mainstream are, and spoiler alert, those chances are pretty good.

They've also provided me with some links for people out there who want to play around with Webauthn, they are below.

Links to all the news items are also below, and you can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/metlstorm'>Adam</a> on Twitter if that floats your boat.
