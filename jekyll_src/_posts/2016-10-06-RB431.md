On this week's show we're taking a look at what the hell the USA should do in response to Russia's hacks against the DNC. A few days ago the Director of National Intelligence and DHS issued a joint statement that officially puts blame for the DNC hacks squarely on Russia. Since then the Internets have been in meltdown over what exactly should be done in response.

Cyber policy lady Mara Tam is this week's feature guest. She'll tell us what sort of reaction we can expect to see, as well as give us some context around why all this is happening in the first place. That's this week's feature interview.

This week's show is brought to you by the fine folks at Bugcrowd. This week's sponsor interview is with Bugcrowd founder and CEO Casey Ellis. Recently a company that makes static analysis software took a bit of a poke at bug bounties in its marketing. If anything it was kind of an acknowledgement that Bugcrowd and its competitors have had a pretty substantial impact on how testing actually gets done.

But are people actually thinking of services like managed bug bounties as a substitute for static analysis? And why is every single company that makes developer tools scrambling to become agile or devops ready when hardly anyone is actually doing it yet?

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest.

Oh, and do add [Patrick](https://twitter.com/riskybusiness) and [Adam](https://twitter.com/metlstorm) on Twitter if that's your thing.
