<p>It's Halloween tonight, so we thought \xc2\xa0we'd take a look at botnets and zombies... grrrr... braaaaaaiiiiiinnnnns!!</p>
<p>On this week's show:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZDNet Australia's Munir Kotadia discusses the news</li>
<li>Arbor Networks' country manager for Australia, Nick Race, pops in for a chat about botnet and zombie detection</li>
<li>Verizon Business Security Solutions Andrew Valentine talks PCI DSS -- apparently it's made sniffers pretty popular</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry we were late this week -- <em>Risky Business's </em>schedule was really tight and wound up being completely thrown by a delayed flight from Coolangatta to Melbourne on Monday evening. So it goes. Oh, and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already!</p>
