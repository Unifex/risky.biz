We didn't have space to run a feature in this week's show, mostly because we had three weeks of news to catch up on because of my holiday. Adam Boileau is away on a company retreat this week, so Haroon Meer is this week's news guest.

We talk about:

* The Russia indictment
* Chrome now marks http sites as "not secure"
* Julian Assange is close to being turfed out of his London digs
* Microsoft's midterm meddling misfire
* Singapore loses 1.5m health records
* Some cool research from Talos and Cyberark
* Azimuth Security acquired by L3
* The npm supply-chain attack
* Chrome site isolation
* And much more!

This week's sponsor is ICEBRG. And ICEBRG just announced today that it's been acquired by Gigamon, which is pretty big news for them. So we'll spend a couple of minutes talking about that with ICEBRG's Jason Rebholz. Then we'll be talking to Justin Warner about a pretty cool Flash 0day they found hiding in a Microsoft Office document. That was some pretty cool work, and the attackers in that case did some pretty novel things in terms of keeping their payload away from prying eyes. Obviously they didn't do a good enough job or we wouldn't be talking about it, but there are some new techniques there, fun stuff.

*****NOTE: At one point I get Jason Rebholz's name wrong. I call him Justin Rebholz by accident. Apologies for the error, Jason!
