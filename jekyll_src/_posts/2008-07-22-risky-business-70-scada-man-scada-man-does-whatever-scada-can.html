<p>This week's feature interview is with Morgan Marquis-Boire, a pen tester and principal consultant with Security-Assessment.com in NZ. Morgan loves playing with SCADA systems, so much so that he's due to give a <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html#Marquis-boire" target="new">SCADA talk at DEFCON</a> in Vegas this year.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>In this Risky Business interview Morgan pops the hype bubble on the "China thing", talks about messing with non-IP wireless protocols (serial) used in SCADA deployments, and more.</p>
<p>This week's sponsor interview is a lot of fun, too. We've got our favourite industry cynic, Marcus J Ranum, coming on to the show to discuss deperimiterisation. </p>
<p>We also discuss the week's news with Munir Kotadia from <i><a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/" target="new">ZDNet Australia</a></i>.</p>
