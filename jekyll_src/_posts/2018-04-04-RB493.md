This week's show is just the news segment and sponsor interview. But, as always, there's plenty to discuss with our news guest Adam Boileau!

In this week's sponsor interview we'll be hearing from Timothy Keeler from Remediant. 

Remediant is a small but growing company that does privileged account management stuff, but they're not a password vault. Tim's joining us this week to walk through some of the challenges of managing privileged access in devops environments and also to talk a bit about some of the challenges around single sign on and privilege management. It's all good stuff, and it's coming up after the news.
