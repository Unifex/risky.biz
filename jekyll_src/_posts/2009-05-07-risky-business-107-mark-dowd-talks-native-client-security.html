<p>Thanks to our sponsor Sophos, this week's edition of the Risky Business podcast is ready to download!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>This week's feature interview is pretty kickass; a chat with security megalegend Mark Dowd. We talk to Mark about his entry in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/" target="new">Native Client security competition</a>. It's very interesting stuff that could really have implications for your job in a few years.</p>
<p>Sean Richmond, who works for Sophos in Sydney, will be along in this week's sponsor interview to discuss the PDF format. We ask Sean why PDF readers like Acrobat Reader have been pretty bug prone lately. </p>
<p>Adam Boileau is this week's news guest. </p>
