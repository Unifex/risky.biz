<p>Risky Business has been judged Australia's Best Technology Audio Program for a second year in a row.</p>
<p>
The Lizzies, Australia's awards for technology journalism, are run by media services company MediaConnect, with each gong judged by a panel of three technology journalists.</p>
<p>
Risky.Biz edged out entries from Sydney-based radio station 2GB, CNet/ZDNet and others.</p>
<p>
Big thanks to the listeners, sponsors, guests and everyone who's helped out since the podcast launched back in early 2007.</p>
