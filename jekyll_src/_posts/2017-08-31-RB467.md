In this week's show we recap all the week's major security news items. St Jude Medical products will be patched in half a million patients, we get the latest with the DreamHost warrant, find out how Hansa marketplace members were de-cloaked by the Dutch cops and more.

In this week's feature interview we chat with Scott Helme about HTTP Public Key Pinning as an attack vector. If someone manages to hack own your domain registrar, they can now cause all sorts of havoc. First, they redirect people to a box they control, then obtain a free, automated domain validated cert for that box, then flick on the HPKP header and pin every visitor to a certificate and key that they control. 

You get your domain back, sure, but then what? Nobody who visited your site while it was under the attacker's control can visit it. Yay. So Scott will join us this week to talk about HPKP ransom and what we might do about this situation.

This week's sponsor interview is fascinating. We chat with Homer Strong, director of data science at Cylance, about machine learning explainability and "interrogatability". 

Adam Boileau is on a company retreat this week, so Haroon Meer is filling in. Links to everything are below.

Oh, and you can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/haroonmeer'>Haroon</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
