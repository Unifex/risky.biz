<p>We've got a great show this week. Australia's welfare agency, Centrelink, has written its own smart card authentication protocol and it's released it to the public. It's called <a href="https://www.govdex.gov.au/confluence/display/PLAID/Home" target="new">PLAID</a> and the plan is to have it recognised an ISO standard. It's an extremely ambitious project and Centrelink's smart card architect Glenn Mitchell will be along to talk about it. </p>
<p>We also chat to Tenable Network Security's Marcus Ranum in this week's sponsor interview. We spoke about the recent hysteria around Chinese hackers apparently downloading the plans for America's Join Strike Fighter. </p>
<p>Freelance security dude <a href="http://storm.net.nz" target="new">Adam "Metlstorm" Boileau</a> is this week's news guest.</p>
<p>We'd like to hear your thoughts on PLAID, too. Do you think it's a waste of time and taxpayer money or a masterstroke? Call Sydney 02 8569 1835 or USA +1 877 688 8417 (Toll free)... or go to the risky.biz forums.</p>
