In this edition of Soap Box we're chatting with <a href='https://root9b.com'>Root9b</a>. They've just launched an updated version of their ORION platform. And I guess the way you'd describe Root9b is as a threat hunt product maker and managed threat hunt provider. And their approach is a bit different -- their software is agentless. They basically authenticate to a machine, inject various payloads into memory, and use that to pull back all sorts of telemetry from machines. 

They say this means it's much less likely that attackers will see them and they offer this as a product, ORION, or they offer it as a service. They say their managed services customers come to them because pretty unhappy with their MDR and MSSP providers and want better signalling.

So I was joined by John Harbaugh, COO of Root9b, and Mike Morris, CTO. Both of these guys were US Air Force cyberdudes before jumping out to the private sector. The company actually started off doing training before developing their platform ORION.

John and Mike joined me by Skype for this podcast. Enjoy!
