<p>In this week's show we're taking a look at a new technology from Immunity Inc. It's called El Jefe and it's actually pretty interesting.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Instead of monitoring network traffic, <a href="http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2010-October/006208.html" target="new">El Jefe</a> keeps an eye on processes running on all your machines. It's a pretty interesting intrusion detection strategy and I think it's got legs. </p>
<p>Justin Seitz of Immunity joins the show to tell us all about it.</p>
<p>This week's sponsor interview is a funny one -- we've got Symantec's Kevin Haley on the show to talk about an unexpected problem the bad guys are facing: piracy! </p>
<p>It turns out there is no honour among thieves -- the creators of malware like Zeus have a problem with people using unlicensed copies of their badness. So how have malware authors responded? They're shipping anti-piracy dongles! </p>
<p>Adam Boileau, as always, joins us to discuss the week's news.</p>
