<p>This podcast entirely consists of a sponsored interview with Symantec's director of Security Response, Vincent Weafer.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>We're absolutely stoked to have Symantec on board -- with them sponsoring we now have the means to expand what we can offer you on Risky.Biz. </p>
<p>Thanks to this relationship you'll be hearing regular podcasts from our new RB2 reporter, Paul Craig.</p>
<p>These sponsored podcasts are a way for Symantec to get out there and talk about topics it knows well. Let's face it, they've been in anti-malware since the woolly mammoths was a common form of  transport and following its acquisition of MessageLabs, Symantec is a big player in Anti-Spam as well.</p>
<p>So I got Vincent on the line and we talked about everything from Gumblar to the latest trends in spam, to the US Federal Trade Commission's role in shutting down rogue service provider 3FN. Enjoy!</p>
