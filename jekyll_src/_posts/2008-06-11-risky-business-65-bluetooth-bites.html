<p>This week's show is sponsored by Check Point Software and hosted by Vigabyte. In Risky Business 65 we take a look at all things wireless with Assurance.com.au's Neal Wise. </p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>The news of a gaping hole in Microsoft's Bluetooth stack has given the topic some currency, so we brought Neal on the show to talk to us about Bluetooth and 802.11 headaches. Neal conducted this year's wireless workshop at the AusCERT conference on the Gold Coast. (Highlight? Taking his class war driving in the War Bus... some of them were law enforcement types. Chortle.) He goes through some of the funky stuff you can do with Bluetooth in particular, before we have a chat about 802.11 shenanigans.</p>
