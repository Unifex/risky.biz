On this week's show we chat with Charlie Miller all about the security of autonomous vehicles. As you'll hear, he says autonomous vehicle security all comes down to some security fundamentals that are, in fact, being taken seriously by carmakers.

We've got an absolutely fantastic sponsor interview for you this week. This week's show is brought to you by <a href='http://senr.io'>Senrio</a>. They make an IoT network monitoring solution that's actually really good. Stephen Ridley is the founder and head honcho at Senrio. He's a very well known researcher and he joins us this week to talk about a few things.

First up he recaps the gSOAP library bugs the Senrio team found. They were a big deal in July, but as you'll hear, people kinda missed the point. The affected gSOAP library is absolutely everywhere, including in, ahem, browsers. So yeaaaaah. There's that.

Then we move on to the more sponsor-y part of the sponsor interview, talking about Senrio's experience running the IoT hacking village at DEFCON. It was a great time for them, throwing their product at the most hostile IoT network the world has ever seen. To round out the Stephen Ridley omnibus experience we'll also hear about a few training courses he's offering on Android hacking and software exploitation via hardware exploitation.

Adam Boileau joins the show to talk about the week's security news, links to everything are below.
