On this week's show we're chatting with Zeynep Tufekci about how machine learning accelerates the dissemination of crazy s--t, basically. Zeynep's September TED talk titled "We're building a dystopia just to make people click on ads" is a must watch and has been doing the rounds on infosec Twitter over the last couple of weeks. She joins us this week to talk through what we might be able to do about the tendency of online platforms to send people down pretty warped rabbit holes. That's a fascinating chat.

This week's show is brought to you by Senetas. 

Senetas is a Melbourne-based company that develops and manufactures layer 2 encryption gear. They also operate the SureDrop secure file sharing platform and are working on a bunch of cloud crypto tech as well. Julian Fay is CTO over at Senetas and he's along this week to talk us through the bugs Matthew Green and his colleagues found in a bunch of FIPS-certified gear from Fortinet. It's a really, really illuminating chat. I love it when Julian's in the sponsor chair because I always learn a lot.
