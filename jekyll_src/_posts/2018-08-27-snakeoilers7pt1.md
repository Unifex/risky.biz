We've got two vendors pitching their wares in this edition of Snake Oilers. First up we're talking to Rapid7 about its vulnerability scanning and management software. They've made some changes and they've got a couple more coming. This is bread and butter infosec stuff.

Then we're going to hear from the team at ITProTV. They're a video-based online training site, pitching themselves as like a Netflix but for online training. Instead of instructor-led training, they try to make stuff less dry -- half hour training videos with two instructors on all sorts of topics. 

The online training video sector is just booming right now, and ITProTV's co-founder and "edutainer" Don Pezet will be along to walk through all of that.
