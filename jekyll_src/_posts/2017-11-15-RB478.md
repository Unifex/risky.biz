On this week's show we check in with Mara Tam. She'll be telling us why the idea of a so-called "Digital Geneva Convention" is silly. 

Then, after that, Rich Smith of Duo Security will be in the sponsor chair.

You may have heard about some recent research Duo Labs did into Apple EFI patches basically not working/sticking. Rich walks us through that research, why Duo did it, how they did it, and what it can tell us. It might be Mac research but the real worry, as you'll hear, is around Wintel firmware.

Adam Boileau pops by for this week's news discussion. We'll be covering:

* Facebook's plan to combat "non-consensual intimate imagery"
* Wikileaks Vault8 leaks
* Assange sending a "guessed" password to Donald Trump Jnr
* NYTimes reports on the Shadowbears
* Cracking FaceID with a rubber mask
* MOAR
