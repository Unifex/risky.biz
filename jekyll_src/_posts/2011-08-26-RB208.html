<p>This week's feature interview is with anonymous infosec blogger Diocyde.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>He has access to some fairly sensitive shit, so we can't tell you his name and we've had to disguise his voice.</p>
<p>Diocyde is best known as the author of the <a href="http://conanthedestroyer.net" target="new">Veiled Shadows</a> blog. </p>
<p>On it, he's written volumes about state-sponsored attacks against the United States. He's tracked who he says are Chinese malware writers and basically doxed them on the blog. He's advocated a hot cyber-war against China to stop that country from continuing to siphon off US-developed intellectual property and intelligence and he's written it all under the influence of pure fury.</p>
<p>Chinese attacks against the USA make this guy angry, as does the idea that attribution in the cyber sphere is difficult.</p>
<p>Interest in <a href="http://twitter.com/diocyde" target="new">Diocyde's</a> blog really took off when links to it popped up in e-mail stolen from HBGary Federal. Things got even more interesting when a few of his posts not only disappeared from the blog, but also disappeared from Google's cache. </p>
<p>In particular, one post titled "Busting the APT can wide open" went missing. It contained a large amount of intelligence on Chinese malware writers.</p>
<p>It was a fascinating read, and it's been completely removed from the Internet. </p>
<p>Doicyde joined me to discuss his blog, the missing posts, Chinese cyber espionage and attribution.</p>
<p>This week's sponsor interview is with RSA Product Manager Jeffery Carpenter. </p>
<p>This week we're chatting to Jeff about RSA's vision for the future of two-factor authentication. Are soft tokens becoming more popular? Is that a problem? What role will mobile device features like NFC play in the 2FA equation in the future? </p>
<p>Also this week, Adam Boileau joins us with the week's news headlines.</p>
