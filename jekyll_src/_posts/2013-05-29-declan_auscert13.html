<p>In this sponsor interview we're chatting with Declan Ingram of Datacom TSS.</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Datacom TSS is a Canberra-based, national security firm founded by ex Australian government security specialists. These guys specialise in dealing with highly skilled adversaries... Now, when they founded this business a few years ago, there was awareness in government that highly skilled adversaries were a real challenge... but it's really been 2013 where executives at the boardroom level have sat up and taken note of security issues, particularly the issue of APT.</p>
<p>They've realised it isn't just the Google's of the world who are being attacked by state sponsored adversaries -- Oil companies, broadcasters and insurance companies have been absolutely nailed by teams working for the governments of North Korea and Iran, for example. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Mandiant's APT1 report really put the issue on the map for a lot of people who previously just weren't aware of the issues. It's that whole chicken versus egg thing -- are people becoming aware of it because of the media attention or is the media reporting on it because people are becoming aware?</p>
<p>So how has this affected things for a business like Datacom TSS? Declan Ingram joined me to discuss. I started off by asking him how perceptions of sophisticated threats have changed over the last couple of years.</p>
