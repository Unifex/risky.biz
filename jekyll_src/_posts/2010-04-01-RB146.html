<p>There's no feature interview in this week's show -- it has an empty middle, just like an Easter egg!</p>
<!--excerpt-above-->

<p>Between me getting bumped out with a cold for a couple of days last week and this being a four day week, I just couldn't pull one together in time. Apologies.</p>
<p>So on this week's show we've got an extra long news segment with Adam Boileau, which is a bunch of fun. </p>
<p>In it we discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aurora not all it's cracked up to be</li>
<li>RIP SCO</li>
<li>Claims of a Vietnamese government sponsored botnet. (WTF?) </li>
<li>The march of China's great firewall</li>
<li>When two networks are better than one</li>
<li>A $100 kit for sniffing wireless keyboards</li>
</ul>
<p>PLUS!</p>
<ul>
<li>Cisco's latest round of ghastly bugs</li>
<li>Apple's latest round of ghastly bugs</li>
<li>Microsoft's latest round of ghastly bugs</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have an interesting chat with Ron Gula, chief executive of <a href="http://tenablesecurity.com/" target="new">Tenable Network Security</a>, in this week's sponsor interview. The topic is vulnerability scoring and knowing when a vulnerability scan is actually pointless.</p>
