In this week's feature interview I speak with the Australian Prime Minister's cyber security advisor Alastair MacGibbon about what it is that the Australian government is pushing for in terms of industry cooperation around surveillance. 

There's been a lot of hype on this one. "Al Mac" joins the show to work through some of it, and honestly, Australia's push at the moment is the sort of thing I think you can expect to see more of around the world, so this is an interview of global relevance.

Some of that conversation hinges on a blog post I wrote on the weekend. If you want to, you can read that <a href='https://risky.biz/bannedmath/'>here</a>.

This week's show is brought to you by Remediant! 

Remediant makes a product that's designed to make lateral movement through a network much harder. Essentially it's a way to restrict all privileged accounts on your infrastructure until you actually need it. So instead of being able to just log in to your production environment, you can actually set it up so you can enable the privilege you need to a set period of time.

It's a different approach to privilege management than things like password vaults, so if you work in an authentication group you're going to want to hear what they have to say. Remediant CEO Tim Keeler is this week's sponsor guest.

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest. We talk about all the continuing notPetya drama at Maersk and FedEx/TNT, the Alphabay latest and more.
