On this week's show we'll be taking a look at the freshly re-authorised section 702 of the FISA act. As you'll soon hear, the updated section now allows the FBI to search data captured under 702 programs for evidence against US citizens in a bunch of circumstances, including, drum roll please, during investigations with a cyber security tilt. 

The co-founder of the Lawfare blog, law professor and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs at the University of Texas Ausin, Bobby Chesney, will be along in this week's feature to talk about all of that!

In this week's feature interview we're joined by Haroon Meer of Thinkst Canary. Haroon will be along to talk about the effectiveness of various honey tokens. Thinkst has been playing around with this stuff for a couple of years now, and Haroon will be joining us to talk about how they'll will wind up being used in an enterprise context. How do you get detection canaries to scale? That's coming up later.

Adam Boileau, as always, pops in to discuss the week's news. It's been a relatively calm week, but we've got some interesting news about botched Spectre patches and a discussion around a sensational report about Kaspersky Lab published by Buzzfeed in conjunction with Russian outlet Meduza.
