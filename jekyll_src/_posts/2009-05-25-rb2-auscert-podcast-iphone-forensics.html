<p>In this recorded AusCERT presentation you'll hear Forward Discovery's Steve Whalen discussing forensic techniques for the iPhone. This is VERY niche stuff, mostly of interest to forensics guys and gals. That said, a lot of security people use iPhones so some may be interested to know what sort of techniques apply to a device they carry. Enjoy!</p>
