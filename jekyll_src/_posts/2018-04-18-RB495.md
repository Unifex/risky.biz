We're still running in a trimmed down format this week, sorry about that. Regular listeners would know we've been dealing with some unexpected stuff over here in the house of Business, but the good news is things have settled down and we're actually back home after more than three weeks away. Things are looking good for a return to a full format show either next week or the week after.

But don't worry, there's plenty of good stuff in this week's news segment with Mark Piper, including:

* Russia blocking 15m cloud service IPs to shut down Telegram
* RU router hax: Are they a big deal?
* FBI's "going dark" narrative questioned
* Rob Joyce departs White House
* ZTE in all sorts of trouble
* AND MOAR

This week's show is brought to you by Cylance. Jim Walter of Cylance will be along in this week's sponsor interview to talk about a couple of things -- we'll be looking at "fileless" malware -- for what it's worth it's a term that we both hate -- and we'll also be talking about how complete amateurs are now able to run reasonably sophisticated malware campaigns these days thanks to the badware for hire business getting even more slick.

The show notes/links are below, and you can follow <a href='https://twitter.com/dotslashpipe'>Pipes</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/riskybusiness'>Patrick</a> on Twitter if that's your thing.
