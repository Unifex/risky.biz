On this week's show Adam pops in to discuss the week's news. (Links below) After the news segment Adam and Patrick both chat about topics near and dear to their hearts: Shoddy infosec marketing and shoddy MSP security.

This week's show is brought to you by WordFence, a company that makes a WordPress security plugin. It's not so much an enterprise security tool, but it turns out that when you run two million Wordpress plugins you wind up collecting some pretty valuable threat intel and IOCs. WordFence's Mark Maunder joins the show this week to talk about WordPress security and malware distribution!
