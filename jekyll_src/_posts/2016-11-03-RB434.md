On this week's show we chat with Errata Security's Robert Graham about a ridiculous non-story that had readers in the USA convinced that Slate magazine had uncovered a covert communication channel between Donald Trump and a state-linked Russian bank. The basis of this jaw-dropping conclusion? Cherry-picked DNS query logs. We'll find out why that story was total, utter bullshit in this week's feature.

In this week's sponsor interview we're chatting with the former CEO and CTOs of Flawcheck, a company that made vulnerability scanning tools for Docker containers. Flawcheck has been acquired by this week's sponsor, Tenable Network Security, and it's a really handy thing to use if your company makes use of Docker. You can actually register for a free trial of Flawcheck <a href='http://tenable.com/flawcheck'>here</a>. We'll find out why you need specialist kit to do container scanning.

Adam Boileau is this week's news guest. Links to everything are in this week's <a href='http://risky.biz/RB434_notes'>show notes</a>.
