# Risky Business - a podcast

This is the source that generats the site at http://risky.biz.

It came about because [I](https://github.com/Unifex) had some time on my hands and was wanting wanting to learn [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Patrick had also been wanting to migrate the site to a more secure system and due to the nature of the site there was no real need for a full blown CMS or even DB driven blog engine behind it. Jekyll seemed like a good compromise.

While this site is geared towards podcasts it will serve nicely as a stand alone blog. Regarding the podcasts, Patrick hosts his media on a separate CND so none of the larger files are in this repo.
